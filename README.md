# Causal Analyser

A model that answers queries using a given corpus and provides responses supported by clear, evidence-based explanations, ensuring both accuracy and interpretability.
Use Case: Reads articles and maps how events influence each other over time - how policy changes affect market reactions.

Addendum:

Me: [Inside zip] Apple, nvidia & J&J ke annual reports ke pdf h.
Chanakya bhaiya:  Haa 
And Is me I haven’t given u a query set 
Cause there doesn’t exist a perfect causal query set 
So I don’t expect a comprehensive eval with metrics but instead just a few sample queries and instead I want u to give me metrics which can be used to evaluate such a system 
I will give u a hint why conventional retriever metrics like accuracy precision recall etc might fail 
That is cause there is not one set answer ie there can be multiple causes for an event and the way it is framed in the output as a combination might vary from system to system 
Aese bohot sare cases hai so socho what can u use o and take care of that
Me: Toh basically, evaluation matters more than the system itself?
Chanakya bhaiya: No the system is still the priority 
I just want you to also understand why standard metrics are not enough and what else can you do
