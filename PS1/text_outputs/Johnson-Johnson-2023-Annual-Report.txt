Annual Report

Our Credo 
We believe our first responsibility is to the patients, doctors and nurses, 
to mothers and fathers and all others who use our products and 
services. In meeting their needs everything we do must be of high 
quality. We must constantly strive to provide value, reduce our costs 
and maintain reasonable prices. Customers' orders must be serviced 
promptly and accurately. Our business partners must have an 
opportunity to make a fair profit. 
We are responsible to our employees who work with us throughout the 
world. We must provide an inclusive work environment where each 
person must be considered as an individual. We must respect their 
diversity and dignity and recognize their merit. They must have a sense 
of security, fulfillment and purpose in their jobs. Compensation must be 
fair and adequate and working conditions clean, orderly and safe. We 
must support the health and well-being of our employees and help them 
fulfill their family and other personal responsibilities. Employees must 
feel free to make suggestions and complaints. There must be equal 
opportunity for employment, development and advancement for those 
qualified. We must provide highly capable leaders and their actions must 
be just and ethical. 
We are responsible to the communities in which we live and work and to 
the world community as well. We must help people be healthier by 
supporting better access and care in more places around the world. We 
must be good citizens - support good works and charities, better health 
and education, and bear our fair share of taxes. We must maintain in 
good order the property we are privileged to use, protecting the 
environment and natural resources. 
Our final responsibility is to our stockholders. Business must make 
a sound profit. We must experiment with new ideas. Research must be 
carried on, innovative programs developed, investments made for the 
future and mistakes paid for. New equipment must be purchased, new 
facilities provided and new products launched. Reserves must be 
created to provide for adverse times. When we operate according to 
these principles, the stockholders should realize a fair return.

March 2024 
Dear shareholders, 
2023 was a defining moment in Johnson & Johnson's 
138-year history. 
It was a year of transformation and growth that has 
positioned our company to be a leader in global healthcare 
for decades to come. 
With the successful separation of our consumer health 
business, we entered a new era — one exclusively focused 
on tackling the world's toughest health challenges through 
scientific innovation and technology. 
We remain the world's largest, most diversified healthcare 
products company, and Johnson & Johnson is now moving 
forward as a more focused and agile organization, with a 
stronger growth and margin profile. 
Operating as a company focused on delivering innovative 
medicines and medical technologies has strengthened 
our position as an innovation powerhouse. Today, we are 
innovating for patients across a spectrum of healthcare 
solutions in ways no other company can, and our impact 
is significant. 
Performance and priorities 
In 2023, we delivered strong and sustained performance 
with 9.0% operational sales growth*, excluding the COVID-19 
vaccine. Adjusted net earnings were $25.4 billion*. Adjusted 
diluted net earnings per share was $9.92*, an increase of 
11.1% from 2022. 
We maintained a healthy balance sheet and robust credit 
rating, underscoring the stability of our financial position, 
and executed against all our capital allocation priorities. We 
remain a top investor in innovation, funding $15.1 billion in 
R&D, or almost 18% of 2023 sales — an all-time high for the 
company. 
We committed over $3 billion to external growth 
opportunities in the last 12 months, including the acquisitions 
of Ambrx and Laminar, and more than 50 smaller, early-stage 
licensing deals and partnerships. We increased our dividend 
for the 61st consecutive year and completed the share 
repurchase program initiated in 2022, returning a total of 
over $14 billion to shareholders. Innovative Medicine 
We are leading where medicine is going, and for the 12th 
consecutive year we reported above-market growth for 
our Innovative Medicine business. This strong performance 
was fueled by growth in key brands such as DARZALEX, 
ERLEADA, STELARA and TREMFYA, and the acceleration of 
recently launched products, including CARVYKTI, SPRAVATO, 
TALVEY and TECVAYLI. 
We made significant advances in our pipeline, with FDA 
approvals for AKEEGA and TALVEY, and positive Phase 
III data readouts for 11 in-line and pipeline medicines. We 
initiated Phase III clinical development programs for milvexian 
and our targeted oral peptide, JNJ-2113, and received FDA 
Breakthrough Therapy Designation for TAR-200 for the 
treatment of bladder cancer. Milvexian also received FDA 
Fast Track designations in atrial fibrillation, stroke, and acute 
coronary syndrome. 
With 19 U.S. and EU filings across Innovative Medicine in 
2023, we have high expectations for the year ahead. 
MedTech 
Innovating at the intersection of biology and technology, our 
MedTech businesses delivered over $30 billion in sales, with 
sales growth across Orthopaedics, Surgery, Interventional 
Solutions, and Vision. 
We progressed 20+ MedTech pipeline programs that each 
have an expected net present value of greater than $100 
million, and launched 15 major products. To increase access 
for patients and deliver clinical differentiation, we produced 
more than 200 scientific publications. 
We built on our commitment to interventional cardiology 
with our successful integration of Abiomed and our 
acquisition of Laminar, a company focused on eliminating the 
left atrial appendage to prevent stroke in AFib patients.

Profoundly impacting health 
for humanity 
Science and technology will advance human health more in 
the next decade than in the last century. It will lead to more 
effective and personalized treatments, earlier intervention, 
and smarter, less invasive healthcare. One example is in lung 
cancer, where doctors can use our robotic bronchoscopy 
to make a diagnosis, perform surgery with our smart 
instruments, and treat with our bispecific antibody. In so 
many ways, we are just getting started. 
We are energized by our future and our evolution at Johnson 
& Johnson, and we remain grounded in our purpose and 
guiding principles. For more than 80 years, Our Credo has 
reminded us of our responsibilities to the people we serve: 
patients, doctors and nurses, employees, communities, 
and investors. 
Our Credo values are as strong as ever. I see them in 
action every day working with my colleagues —a team of 
over 130,000 incredible individuals that includes more 
than 26,000 employees working in R&D, innovation, and 
engineering, and approximately 6,000 data scientists and 
digital experts embedded across our businesses globally. The people of Johnson & Johnson are my greatest source 
of inspiration and the foundation of my confidence in the 
future of our business. Fueled by our shared belief that 
health is everything, and our commitment to investing 
in transformative science and breakthrough technology, 
Johnson & Johnson is poised to lead the next wave of 
innovation. I look forward to seeing what we accomplish 
together in 2024 and beyond.

Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements 
This Annual Report on Form 10-K and Johnson & Johnson's other publicly available documents contain "forward-looking 
statements" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 
1995. Management and representatives of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) also may from time to time 
make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and reflect 
management's assumptions, views, plans, objectives and projections about the future. Forward-looking statements may be 
identified by the use of words such as "plans," "expects," "will," "anticipates," "estimates" and other words of similar meaning in 
conjunction with, among other things: discussions of future operations; expected operating results and financial performance; 
impact of planned acquisitions and dispositions; impact and timing of restructuring initiatives, including associated cost savings 
and other benefits; the Company's strategy for growth; product development activities; regulatory approvals; market position 
and expenditures. 
Because forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events, 
they are subject to uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the 
Company's control. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or 
uncertainties materialize, the Company's actual results and financial condition could vary materially from expectations and 
projections expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Investors are therefore cautioned not to rely on these 
forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: 
Risks related to product development, market success and competition 
• Challenges and uncertainties inherent in innovation and development of new and improved products and technologies on 
which the Company's continued growth and success depend, including uncertainty of clinical outcomes, additional analysis 
of existing clinical data, obtaining regulatory approvals, health plan coverage and customer access, and initial and continued 
commercial success; 
• Challenges to the Company's ability to obtain and protect adequate patent and other intellectual property rights for new 
and existing products and technologies in the United States and other important markets; 
• The impact of patent expirations, typically followed by the introduction of competing generic, biosimilar or other products 
and resulting revenue and market share losses; 
• Increasingly aggressive and frequent challenges to the Company's patents by competitors and others seeking to launch 
competing generic, biosimilar or other products and increased receptivity of courts, the United States Patent and 
Trademark Office and other decision makers to such challenges, potentially resulting in loss of market exclusivity and rapid 
decline in sales for the relevant product sooner than expected; 
• Competition in research and development of new and improved products, processes and technologies, which can result in 
product and process obsolescence; 
• Competition to reach agreement with third parties for collaboration, licensing, development and marketing agreements for 
products and technologies; 
• Competition based on cost-effectiveness, product performance, technological advances and patents attained by 
competitors; and 
• Allegations that the Company's products infringe the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, which 
could adversely affect the Company's ability to sell the products in question and require the payment of money damages 
and future royalties. 
Risks related to product liability, litigation and regulatory activity 
• Product efficacy or safety concerns, whether or not based on scientific evidence, potentially resulting in product 
withdrawals, recalls, regulatory action on the part of the United States Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) (or 
international counterparts), declining sales, reputational damage, increased litigation expense and share price impact; 
• The impact, including declining sales and reputational damage, of significant litigation or government action adverse to 
the Company, including product liability claims and allegations related to pharmaceutical marketing practices and 
contracting strategies; 
• The impact of an adverse judgment or settlement and the adequacy of reserves related to legal proceedings, including 
patent litigation, product liability, personal injury claims, securities class actions, government investigations, employment 
and other legal proceedings; .-"('+2'(-+ +"' (+0+D%(($"' ,--&'-,

• Increased scrutiny of the healthcare industry by government agencies and state attorneys general resulting in investigations 
and prosecutions, which carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties, including, but not limited to, debarment from 
government business; 
• Failure to meet compliance obligations in compliance agreements with governments or government agencies, which could 
result in significant sanctions; 
• Potential changes to applicable laws and regulations affecting United States and international operations, including relating 
to: approval of new products; licensing and patent rights; sales and promotion of healthcare products; access to, and 
reimbursement and pricing for, healthcare products and services; environmental protection; and sourcing of raw materials; 
• Compliance with local regulations and laws that may restrict the Company's ability to manufacture or sell its products in 
relevant markets, including requirements to comply with medical device reporting regulations and other requirements such 
as the European Union's Medical Devices Regulation; 
• Changes in domestic and international tax laws and regulations, increasing audit scrutiny by tax authorities around the world 
and exposures to additional tax liabilities potentially in excess of existing reserves; and 
• The issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and regulations by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Risks related to the Company's strategic initiatives, healthcare market trends and the realization of benefits from the 
separation of the Company's Consumer Health Business 
• Pricing pressures resulting from trends toward healthcare cost containment, including the continued consolidation among 
healthcare providers and other market participants, trends toward managed care, the shift toward governments increasingly 
becoming the primary payors of healthcare expenses, significant new entrants to the healthcare markets seeking to reduce 
costs and government pressure on companies to voluntarily reduce costs and price increases; 
• Restricted spending patterns of individual, institutional and governmental purchasers of healthcare products and services 
due to economic hardship and budgetary constraints; 
• Challenges to the Company's ability to realize its strategy for growth including through externally sourced innovations, such 
as development collaborations, strategic acquisitions, licensing and marketing agreements, and the potential heightened 
costs of any such external arrangements due to competitive pressures; 
• The potential that the expected strategic benefits and opportunities from any planned or completed acquisition or 
divestiture by the Company may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected; 
• The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to past and ongoing restructuring actions may not be 
realized or may take longer to realize than expected; 
• The Company's ability to divest the Company's remaining ownership interest in Kenvue Inc. (Kenvue) and realize the 
anticipated benefits from the separation; and 
• Kenvue's ability to succeed as a standalone publicly traded company. 
Risks related to economic conditions, financial markets and operating internationally 
• The risks associated with global operations on the Company and its customers and suppliers, including foreign governments 
in countries in which the Company operates; 
• The impact of inflation and fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates and the potential effect of such 
fluctuations on revenues, expenses and resulting margins; 
• Potential changes in export/import and trade laws, regulations and policies of the United States and other countries, 
including any increased trade restrictions or tariffs and potential drug reimportation legislation; 
• The impact on international operations from financial instability in international economies, sovereign risk, possible 
imposition of governmental controls and restrictive economic policies, and unstable international governments and 
legal systems; 
• The impact of global public health crises and pandemics; C

• Changes to global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters that could affect demand for the Company's products 
and services, cause disruptions in manufacturing and distribution networks, alter the availability of goods and services within 
the supply chain, and affect the overall design and integrity of the Company's products and operations; 
• The impact of global or economic changes or events, including global tensions and war; and 
• The impact of armed conflicts and terrorist attacks in the United States and other parts of the world, including social and 
economic disruptions and instability of financial and other markets. 
Risks related to supply chain and operations 
• Difficulties and delays in manufacturing, internally, through third-party providers or otherwise within the supply chain, that 
may lead to voluntary or involuntary business interruptions or shutdowns, product shortages, withdrawals or suspensions of 
products from the market, and potential regulatory action; 
• Interruptions and breaches of the Company's information technology systems or those of the Company's vendors, which 
could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action; 
• Reliance on global supply chains and production and distribution processes that are complex and subject to increasing 
regulatory requirements that may adversely affect supply, sourcing and pricing of materials used in the Company's 
products; and 
• The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to restructuring actions may not be realized or may take 
longer to realize than expected, including due to any required approvals from applicable regulatory authorities. 
Investors also should carefully read the risk factors described in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of 
certain risks that could, among other things, cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those expressed in its 
forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and 
should not consider the risks described above and in Item 1A to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. 
The Company does not undertake to publicly update any forward-looking statement that may be made from time to time, 
whether as a result of new information or future events or developments. C$*# /0+#(+((%)0 C 50. ) 4 0$ .**01.(%//0 . /0$0+1("" 0 )*"+.0$ +),*6P/,.+10/

research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. Johnson & Johnson is a 
holding company, with operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world. The Company's primary 
focus is products related to human health and well-being. Johnson & Johnson was incorporated in the State of New Jersey 
in 1887. 
The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations 
and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Company's two 
business segments: Innovative Medicine (previously referred to as Pharmaceutical) and MedTech. Within the strategic 
parameters provided by the Committee, senior management groups at U.S. and international operating companies are each 
responsible for their own strategic plans and the day-to-day operations of those companies. Each subsidiary within the 
business segments is, with limited exceptions, managed by residents of the country where located. 
Segments of business 
Following the completion of the separation of the Consumer Health business (Kenvue) in August 2023, the Company is now 
organized into two business segments: Innovative Medicine and MedTech. Additional information required by this item is 
incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular descriptions of segments and operating results under: Item 7. 
Management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition of this Report; and Note 17 Segments of 
business and geographic areas of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. 
Innovative Medicine 
The Innovative Medicine segment is focused on the following therapeutic areas: Immunology (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, 
psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis), Infectious Diseases (e.g., HIV/AIDS), Neuroscience (e.g., mood 
disorders, neurodegenerative disorders and schizophrenia), Oncology (e.g., prostate cancer, hematologic malignancies, lung 
cancer and bladder cancer), Cardiovascular and Metabolism (e.g., thrombosis, diabetes and macular degeneration) and 
Pulmonary Hypertension (e.g., Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension). Medicines in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, 
wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use. Key products in the Innovative Medicine 
segment include: REMICADE (infliximab), a treatment for a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases; SIMPONI 
(golimumab), a subcutaneous treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis, 
active ankylosing spondylitis and moderately active to severely active ulcerative colitis; SIMPONI ARIA (golimumab), an 
intravenous treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis and active ankylosing 
spondylitis and active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) in people 2 years of age and older; STELARA 
(ustekinumab), a treatment for adults and children with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, for adults with active psoriatic 
arthritis, for adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease and treatment of moderately to severely active 
ulcerative colitis; TREMFYA (guselkumab), a treatment for adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and active psoriatic 
arthritis; EDURANT (rilpivirine), PREZISTA (darunavir) and PREZCOBIX/REZOLSTA (darunavir/cobicistat), antiretroviral 
medicines for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in combination with other antiretroviral products and 
SYMTUZA (darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide), a once-daily single tablet regimen for the treatment of 
HIV; CONCERTA (methylphenidate HCI) extended -release tablets CII, a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; 
INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION (paliperidone palmitate), for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder in 
adults; INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA (paliperidone palmitate), for the treatment of schizophrenia in patients after they have 
been adequately treated with INVEGA SUSTENNA for at least four months; SPRAVATO (Esketamine), a nasal spray, used along 
with an oral antidepressant, to treat adults with treatment -resistant depression (TRD) and depressive symptoms in adults with 
major depressive disorder (MDD) with suicidal thoughts or actions; CARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene autoleucel), a chimeric antigen 
receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapy for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma; ZYTIGA (abiraterone

acetate), a treatment for patients with prostate cancer; ERLEADA (apalutamide), a next-generation androgen receptor 
inhibitor for the treatment of patients with prostate cancer; IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib), a treatment for certain B-cell malignancies, 
or blood cancers and chronic graft versus host disease; DARZALEX (daratumumab), a treatment for multiple myeloma; 
DARZALEX FASPRO (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj), a treatment for multiple myeloma and light chain (AL) Amyloidosis; 
XARELTO (rivaroxaban), an oral anticoagulant for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead to pulmonary 
embolism (PE) in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery, to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in 
patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and for the treatment and reduction of risk of recurrence of DVT and PE to reduce 
the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral artery disease (PAD), for 
the treatment and secondary prevention of thromboembolism in pediatric patients, and for thromboprophylaxis in pediatric 
patients following the Fontan procedure; OPSUMIT (macitentan) as monotherapy or in combination, indicated for the long-
term treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); UPTRAVI (selexipag), the only approved oral and intravenous, 
selective IP receptor agonist targeting a prostacyclin pathway in PAH. Many of these medicines were developed in 
collaboration with strategic partners or are licensed from other companies and maintain active lifecycle 
development programs. 
MedTech 
The MedTech segment includes a broad portfolio of products used in the Interventional Solutions, Orthopaedics, Surgery and 
Vision categories. Interventional Solutions include electrophysiology products (Biosense Webster) to treat heart rhythm 
disorders, the heart recovery portfolio (Abiomed) which includes technologies to treat severe coronary artery disease requiring 
high-risk PCI or AMI cardiogenic shock, and Neurovascular care (Cerenovus) that treats hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. The 
Orthopaedics portfolio (DePuy Synthes) includes products and enabling technologies that support Hips, Knees, Trauma, and 
Spine, Sports & Other. The Surgery portfolios include advanced and general surgery technologies (Ethicon), as well as solutions 
that focus on breast aesthetics (Mentor), and Ear, Nose and Throat (Acclarent) procedures. Johnson & Johnson Vision 
products include ACUVUE Brand contact lenses and TECNIS intraocular lenses for cataract surgery. These products are 
distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used predominantly in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, 
hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. 
Geographic areas 
Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately131,900 employees worldwide engaged in the 
research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts 
business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being. 
The products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under Segments of Business —
Innovative Medicine and MedTech. However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international 
business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include those developed in the U.S. 
and by subsidiaries abroad. 
Investments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities 
because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive 
economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties. 
Raw materials 
Raw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are 
exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial 
results of the Company. 
Patents 
The Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where 
possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries relating to their 
products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material 
importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company's subsidiaries face patent challenges from third 
parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key

pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. Significant legal proceedings 
and claims involving the Company's patent and other intellectual property are described in Note 19 Legal proceedings —
Intellectual property of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. 
Sales of the Company's largest product, STELARA (ustekinumab) accounted for approximately 12.8% of the Company's total 
revenues for fiscal 2023. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Janssen 
Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, owns patents specifically related to STELARA. The latest 
expiring United States composition of matter patent expired in 2023. As a result of settlements and other agreements with 
third parties, the Company does not anticipate the launch of a biosimilar version of STELARA before January 1, 2025 in the 
United States. The latest expiring European composition of matter patent (Supplementary Protection Certificate) expires in 
2024. 
Sales of the Company's second largest product, collectively DARZALEX (daratumumab) and DARZALEX FASPRO 
(daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj), accounted for approximately 11.4% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2023. 
Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Genmab A/S owns two patent 
families related to DARZALEX, and Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patent families. The two patent 
families both expire in the United States in 2029, and in Europe, compound patent protection in select countries extends to 
2031/2032. Janssen Biotech, Inc. owns a separate patent portfolio related to DARZALEX FASPRO. 
Trademarks 
The Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for 
these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S. and other countries where 
such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the 
operation of its businesses. 
Seasonality 
Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has typically been heavier in the fourth 
quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for research and 
development activity. 
Competition 
In all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally. Competition exists 
in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, 
both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and 
processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying 
intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company's success in all areas of its business. 
The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. 
Environment 
The Company is subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions. The 
Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The 
Company's compliance with these requirements is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash 
flows, earnings or competitive position.

Regulation 
The Company's businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are 
conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement. The Company is subject to 
costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially 
adversely affect the Company's financial condition and business operations. In the U.S., the pharmaceutical product and 
medical technology industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to 
product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the U.S. FDA) continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and 
documentation required for U.S. FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of 
product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the U.S. 
The new medical device regulatory framework and the evolving privacy, data localization, and emerging cyber security laws and 
regulations around the world are examples of such increased regulation. Within the U.S., an increasing number of U.S. States 
have enacted comprehensive privacy laws and federal regulators (e.g., the U.S. FDA, FTC and HHS) continue to stress the 
intersection of health and privacy as a compliance and enforcement priority. In the EU, multiple directives and laws (including 
NIS2, EHDS, the Data Act, the Cyber Resilience Act, and the Al Act) are rapidly changing privacy and cybersecurity compliance 
requirements while introducing new enforcement risks. In addition, China has introduced broad personal information protection 
and data security regulations, with more anticipated, thereby increasing China's scrutiny of company compliance and data 
transfer practices. With other jurisdictions enacting similar privacy laws, local data protection authorities will force greater 
accountability on the collection, access and use of personal data in the healthcare industry. These laws can also restrict 
transfers of data across borders, potentially impacting how data-driven health care solutions are developed and deployed 
globally in a compliant manner. Moreover, as a result of the broad scale release and availability of Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
technologies such as generative AI, a global trend towards more comprehensive and nuanced regulation (e.g., White House's 
Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence; the EU Al Act) to ensure 
the ethical use, privacy, and security of Al is underway that includes standards for transparency, accountability, and fairness, 
which will require compliance developments or enhancements. 
The regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions 
such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Company's 
subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls regardless of whether it has been required or directed to. 
The U.S. FDA and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities. If the U.S. FDA were to 
conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our pharmaceutical products or 
medical technologies are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the U.S. FDA could ban such products, detain or seize 
adulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products, refuse to grant pending 
applications for marketing authorization or require certificates of foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify 
health professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The U.S. 
FDA may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a 
company-wide basis, or enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law. The U.S. FDA may also 
recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may 
restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future clearances or approvals, and 
could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. Equivalent enforcement mechanisms exist in 
different countries in which we conduct business. 
The costs of human healthcare have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental 
agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused by states, regulatory agencies and 
Congress on prices, profits, overutilization and the quality and costs of healthcare generally. Laws and regulations have been 
enacted to require adherence to strict compliance standards and prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. There is 
increased focus on interactions and financial relationships between healthcare companies and healthcare providers. Various 
state and federal transparency laws and regulations require disclosures of payments and other transfers of value made to 
certain healthcare practitioners, including physicians, teaching hospitals, and certain non-physician practitioners. Federal and 
foreign laws governing international business practices require strict compliance with anti-bribery standards and certain 
prohibitions with respect to payments to any foreign government official. Payors and Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) are 
a potent force in the marketplace, and increased attention is being paid to the impact of PBM practices on healthcare cost and 
access in the U.S. 
Our business has been and continues to be affected by federal and state legislation that alters the pricing, coverage, and 
reimbursement landscape. At the federal level, in August 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act

:
(IRA), which includes provisions that effectively authorize the government to establish prices for certain high-spend 
single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed by the Medicare program, starting in 2026 for Medicare Part D drugs and 2028 
for Medicare Part B drugs. On August 29, 2023, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS") published the first 
"Selected Drug" list, which includes XARELTO and STELARA as well as IMBRUVICA, which is developed in collaboration and co-
commercialized in the U.S. with Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company. The Selected Drug list also included other medicines 
targeting disease states that are prevalent in the Medicare population. There remains uncertainty, however, regarding how the 
federal government will establish prices for the selected products, as the IRA specifies a ceiling price but not a minimum price. 
In any event, we anticipate that the selected products will be subjected to a government -established price for the Medicare 
population. 
The IRA also contains provisions that impose rebates if certain prices increase at a rate that outpaces the rate of inflation, 
beginning October 1, 2022, for Medicare Part D drugs and January 1, 2023, for Medicare Part B drugs. Separate IRA provisions 
redesign the Medicare Part D benefit in various ways, including by shifting a greater portion of costs to manufacturers within 
certain coverage phases and replacing the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new manufacturer discounting 
program. Failure to comply with IRA provisions may subject manufacturers to various penalties, including civil monetary 
penalties. 
In July 2023, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen) filed litigation against the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services challenging the constitutionality of the Inflation Reduction 
Act's (IRA) Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. The litigation requests a declaration that the IRA violates Janssen's 
rights under the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and therefore that Janssen is not subject to 
the IRA's mandatory pricing scheme. The impact of the IRA on our business and the broader pharmaceutical industry remains 
uncertain, as litigation filed by Janssen and other pharmaceutical companies remains ongoing and CMS has yet to publicly 
announce the maximum fair price for each of the selected drugs. 
Additionally, we expect continued scrutiny on drug pricing and government price reporting from Congress, agencies, and other 
bodies at the federal and state levels, which may result in additional regulations or other mechanisms to increase pricing 
transparency and controls. 
There are a number of additional bills pending in Congress and healthcare reform proposals at the state level that would affect 
drug pricing, including in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This changing legal landscape has both positive and negative 
impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of federal and state law, 
and potential modification or repeal of these laws, will ultimately affect the industry. The IRA and any other federal or state 
legislative change could affect the pricing and market conditions for our products. 
In addition, business practices in the healthcare industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the U.S., by 
government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant 
civil and criminal penalties. Of note is the increased enforcement activity by data protection authorities in various jurisdictions, 
particularly in the European Union, where significant fines have been levied on companies for data breaches, violations of 
privacy requirements, and unlawful cross-border data transfers. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission has stepped up 
enforcement of data privacy with several significant settlements (including settlements concerning the downstream sharing of 
personal information and use and disclosure of personal health data) and there have been a material increase in class-action 
lawsuits linked to the collection and use of biometric data and use of tracking technologies. 
Further, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex, and subject 
to increasing regulatory requirements that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company's 
products. These processes also are subject to complex and lengthy regulatory approvals.

Strategy 
The Company believes that its employees are critical to its continued success and are an essential element of its long-term 
strategy. Management is responsible for ensuring that its policies and processes reflect and reinforce the Company's desired 
corporate culture, including policies and processes related to strategy, risk management, and ethics and compliance. The 
Company's human capital management strategy is built on three fundamental focus areas: 
• Attracting and recruiting the best talent 
• Developing and retaining talent 
• Empowering and inspiring talent 
Underpinning these focus areas are ongoing efforts to cultivate and foster a culture built on diversity, equity and inclusion 
(DEI), innovation, health, well-being and safety, where the Company's employees are encouraged to succeed both 
professionally and personally while helping the Company achieve its business goals. 
Culture and employee engagement 
At the Company, employees are guided by Our Credo which sets forth the Company's responsibilities to patients, consumers, 
customers, healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. Employees worldwide must adhere to the 
Company's Code of Business Conduct which sets basic requirements and serves as a foundation for the Company policies, 
procedures and guidelines, all of which provide additional guidance on expected employee behaviors in every market where it 
operates. The Company conducts global surveys that offer its employees the ability to provide feedback and valuable insight 
to help address potential human resources risks and identify opportunities to improve. In 2023, 94% of global employees 
across 76 countries participated in Our Credo Survey which was offered in 36 languages. 
Growth and development 
To lead in the changing healthcare landscape, it is crucial that the Company continue to attract and retain top talent. In 2023, 
the Company's voluntary turnover rate was 7%. The Company believes that its employees must be equipped with the right 
knowledge and skills and be provided with opportunities to grow and develop in their careers. Accordingly, professional 
development programs and educational resources are available to all employees. The Company's objective is to foster a 
learning culture that helps shape each person's unique career path while creating a robust pipeline of talent to deliver on the 
Company's long-term strategies. In furtherance of this objective, the Company deploys a global approach to ensure 
development is for everyone, regardless of where they are on their career journey. To prioritize learning, the Company recently 
held Johnson & Johnson's first Global Learning Day. Employees were encouraged to set aside a full day to explore skill-building 
courses across five areas: leadership, business skills, digital upskilling, DEI, and well-being, on J&J Learn, the Company's new 
learning platform. 
Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) 
The Company is committed to workplace diversity and to cultivating, fostering, and advancing a culture of equity and inclusion. 
The Company's evidenced -based global enterprise Diversity, Equity and Inclusion strategy recognizes how DEI accelerates the 
Company's ability to meet the changing needs of the communities the Company serves in, as outlined in Our Credo. The 
Company's DEI Vision is: Be yourself, change the world. The Company's DEI Mission is: Make diversity, equity and inclusion 
how we work everyday. The Company's enterprise DEI Strategy is aligned to the DEI Vision and Mission and rests on four 
core pillars: 
• Build a workforce of individuals with diverse backgrounds, cultures, abilities and perspectives 
• Foster a culture of inclusion where every individual belongs 
• Transform talent and business processes to achieve equitable opportunities for all 
• Drive innovation and growth with our business to serve diverse markets around the world 
The Company's DEI strategy is guided by internal and external insights, global best practices and continual employee feedback 
and recognizes that while diversity changes by location, inclusion is the same everywhere.

Compensation and benefits 
As part of the Company's total rewards philosophy, the Company offers competitive compensation and benefits to attract and 
retain top talent. The Company is committed to fairness and equitable treatment in its compensation and benefits for 
employees at all levels. The Company observes legal minimum wage provisions and exceeds them where possible. The 
Company's total rewards offerings include an array of programs to support its employees' well-being, including annual 
performance incentive opportunities, pension and retirement savings programs, health and welfare benefits, paid time off, 
leave programs, flexible work schedules and employee assistance programs. In recognition of the Company's commitment to 
help employees balance their personal and professional responsibilities, the Company enhanced its caregiver, bereavement, and 
volunteer paid leave benefits, effective July 2023. 
Health, wellness and safety 
The Company's investment in employee health, well-being and safety is built on its conviction that advancing health for 
humanity starts with advancing the health of its employees. With the right awareness, focus, practices and tools, the Company 
ensures that all its employees around the world, as well as temporary contractors and visitors to the Company's sites, can work 
safely. The Company has continuously expanded health and well-being programs throughout the Company and across the 
globe, incorporating new thinking and technologies to keep its offerings best-in-class and to help employees achieve their 
personal health goals. The programs and practices the Company advances for total health—physical, mental, emotional and 
financial—ensure employee health protection for emerging health risks. The Company continues to address our employees 
needs through J&J Flex, a hybrid model that empowers the Company's office-based employees to find the right productivity 
and balance of in-person and remote work.

Item 1A. Risk factors 
An investment in the Company's common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. The Company seeks to 
identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and many are outside of 
the Company's control and cannot therefore be eliminated. In addition to the other information in this report and the 
Company's other filings with the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors set forth below. Investors should be 
aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is not meant to be a complete 
discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company's 
business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected, potentially in a material way. 
Risks related to our business, industry and operations 
The Company's businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely 
affect the Company's earnings. 
The Company faces substantial competition in its two operating segments and in all geographic markets. The Company's 
businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-effectiveness, technological innovations, intellectual 
property rights, product performance, real or perceived product advantages, pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement. 
The Company also competes with other market participants in securing rights to acquisitions, collaborations and licensing 
agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product candidates and technologies may result in significant 
investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms for the Company. Competitors' development of more effective 
or less costly products, and/or their ability to secure patent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market 
products ahead of the Company, could negatively impact sales of the Company's existing products as well as its ability to bring 
new products to market despite significant prior investment in the related product development. The Company may also 
experience operational and financial risk in connection with acquisitions if we are unable to fully identify potential risks and 
liabilities associated with acquired businesses or products, successfully integrate operations and employees, and successfully 
identify and realize synergies with existing businesses while containing acquisition -related strain on our management, 
operations and financial resources. 
For the Company's Innovative Medicine businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a substantial 
reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and enter the market. 
Similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product. For the Company's MedTech 
businesses, technological innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service are especially important to 
competitiveness. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes and technologies could threaten 
to make the Company's products or technologies less desirable, less economical or obsolete. The Company's business and 
operations will be negatively impacted if we are unable to introduce new products or technological advances that are safe, 
more effective, more effectively marketed or otherwise outperform those of our competitors. 
Interruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Company's business, sales 
and reputation. 
The Company's manufacturing of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex, high-quality 
components and materials. The Company's subsidiaries operate 61 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from thousands 
of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the past, and may in the future, face unanticipated interruptions and delays 
in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing disruptions can occur for many reasons including 
regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor disputes, labor shortages, site-specific incidents (such 
as fires), natural disasters such as hurricanes and other severe weather events, raw material shortages, political unrest, 
terrorist attacks and epidemics or pandemics. Such delays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, 
declines in sales and reputational impact as well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing 
the shortage. 
The Company relies on third parties to manufacture and supply certain of our products. Any failure by or loss of a third-
party manufacturer or supplier could result in delays and increased costs, which may adversely affect our business. 
The Company relies on third parties to manufacture and supply certain of our raw materials, component parts and products. 
We depend on these third-party manufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet 
our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to 
us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. However, we cannot guarantee that these third-party manufacturers will be able 
to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements, which could result in lost sales and have an adverse effect on 
our business.

Other risks associated with our reliance on third parties to manufacture these products include reliance on the third party for 
regulatory compliance and quality assurance, misappropriation of the Company's intellectual property, limited ability to manage 
our inventory, possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party and the possible termination or nonrenewal 
of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. Moreover, if any of our 
third-party manufacturers suffers any damage to facilities, loses benefits under material agreements, experiences power 
outages, encounters financial difficulties, is unable to secure necessary raw materials from its suppliers or suffers any other 
reduction in efficiency, the Company may experience significant business disruption. In the event of any such disruption, the 
Company would need to seek and source other qualified third-party manufacturers, likely resulting in further delays and 
increased costs which could affect our business adversely. 
Counterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings, 
reputation and business. 
Our industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and the presence 
of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the Internet. Third parties may illegally distribute and sell 
counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. To distributors and 
patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version. Counterfeit medicines pose a risk 
to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured — often in unregulated, unlicensed, 
uninspected and unsanitary sites — as well as the lack of regulation of their contents. 
The industry's failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and reputation by 
impacting patient confidence in our authentic products, potentially resulting in lost sales, product recalls, and an increased 
threat of litigation. In addition, diversion of our products from their authorized market into other channels may result in 
reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability. 
Global health crises, pandemics, epidemics, or other outbreaks could adversely disrupt or impact certain aspects of the 
Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. 
We are subject to risks associated with global health crises, epidemics, pandemics and other outbreaks (such incident(s), a 
health crisis or health crises). For example, the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted certain aspects of the Company's 
business, results of operations and financial condition, including lower sales and reduced customer demand and usage of 
certain of our products. The spread of any health crises may cause the Company to modify its business practices, and take 
further actions as may be required by government authorities or as the Company determines are in the best interests of our 
patients, customers, employees and business partners under such circumstances. While the Company has robust business 
continuity plans in place across our global supply chain network designed to help mitigate the impact of health crises, these 
efforts may not completely prevent our business from being adversely affected in the event of a health crisis. Health crises 
could adversely impact the Company's operations, including, among other things, our manufacturing operations, supply chain, 
third-party suppliers, sales and marketing, and clinical trial operations. Any of these factors could adversely affect the 
Company's business, financial results, and global economic conditions generally. 
Risks related to government regulation and legal proceedings 
Global sales in the Company's Innovative Medicine and MedTech segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare 
reforms and increasing pricing pressures. 
Sales of the Company's Innovative Medicine and MedTech products are significantly affected by reimbursements by 
third-party payors such as government healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations. As part 
of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payors are putting downward pressure on prices at which products will be 
reimbursed. In the U.S., increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private 
sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers, could result in further pricing 
pressures. In addition, recent legislation and ongoing political scrutiny on pricing, coverage and reimbursement could result in 
additional pricing pressures. Specifically, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) may subject certain products to 
government -established pricing, potentially impose rebates, and subject manufacturers who fail to adhere to the government's 
interpretations of the law to penalties. Further, increased third-party utilization of the 340B Federal Drug Discount Program 
from expanded interpretations of the statute may have a negative impact on the Company's financial performance. Outside 
the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU, United Kingdom, Japan and China, have pervasive government involvement 
in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose price controls, limit access to, or reimbursement for, the 
Company's products, or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection.

We are subject to an increasing number of costly and complex governmental regulations in the countries in which 
operations are conducted which may materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and 
business operations. 
As described in Item 1. Business, the Company is subject to an increasing number of extensive government laws and regulations, 
investigations and legal action by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which it 
operates. For example, changes to the U.S. FDA's timing or requirements for approval or clearance of our products may have a 
negative impact on our ability to bring new products to market. New laws and regulations may also impose deadlines on the 
Company, or its third-party suppliers, manufacturers or other partners and providers, for which there may be insufficient time 
to implement changes to comply with such new regulations and may result in manufacturing delays or other supply chain 
constraints. If the Company is unable to identify ways to mitigate these delays or constraints, there may be an adverse effect 
on sales and access to our products. 
The Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses, fines and 
reputational damage. 
In the ordinary course of business, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and lawsuits 
involving various issues such as product liability, patent disputes and claims that their product sales, marketing and pricing 
practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or consumer protection laws. The Company's more significant 
legal proceedings are described in Note 19 Legal proceedings under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included 
in Item 8 of this Report. Litigation, in general, and securities, derivative action, class action and multi-district litigation, in 
particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these matters may include thousands of plaintiffs, may involve parties 
seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several 
years. For example, the Company is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, 
primarily JOHNSON'S Baby Powder, and the Company's sale, manufacturing and marketing of opioids. While the Company 
believes it has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The 
Company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these matters, 
potentially in excess of accruals, including matters where the Company could be held jointly and severally liable among other 
defendants. The resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a 
material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period. The Company does not 
purchase third-party product liability insurance; however, the Company utilizes a wholly owned captive insurance company 
subject to certain limits. 
Product reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results of 
operations, lead to litigation and cause reputational damage. 
Concerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not 
based on scientific evidence, can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental investigations, regulatory action on the 
part of the U.S. FDA (or its counterpart in other countries), private claims and lawsuits, payment of fines and settlements, 
declining sales and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and 
consumer trust in the Company's products. Product recalls have in the past, and could in the future, prompt government 
investigations and inspections, the shutdown of manufacturing facilities, continued product shortages and related sales 
declines, significant remediation costs, reputational damage, possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution. 
The Company faces significant regulatory scrutiny, which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the 
Company to government investigations, legal actions and penalties. 
The rapid increase in new government laws and regulations imposes significant compliance costs to the Company and a failure 
of the Company to timely implement changes to comply with these new laws may expose the Company to investigations, legal 
actions or penalties. Regulatory issues regarding compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) (and 
comparable quality regulations in foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs and devices can lead to fines and penalties, 
product recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new product approvals and litigation. In addition, the 
marketing, pricing and sale of the Company's products are subject to regulation, investigations and legal actions including 
under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Medicaid Rebate Program, federal and state false claims acts, state 
unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws. Scrutiny of healthcare industry business practices by government 
agencies and state attorneys general in the U.S., and any resulting investigations and prosecutions, carry risk of significant civil 
and criminal penalties including, but not limited to, debarment from participation in government healthcare programs. Any such 
debarment could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations. The most significant 
current investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 19 Legal proceedings —Government 
proceedings under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.

Changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company's operating results. 
Changes in tax laws or regulations around the world, including in the U.S. and as led by the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development, such as the recent enactment by certain EU and non-EU countries, and the anticipated 
enactment by additional countries, of a global minimum tax, could negatively impact the Company's effective tax rate and 
results of operations. A change in statutory tax rate or certain international tax provisions in any country would result in the 
revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the 
new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company's Consolidated Statement 
of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to tax 
laws or regulations may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter 
and year in which the law change is enacted. 
See Note 8 Income taxes under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional 
information. 
The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes with 
many tax authorities. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose more information to 
tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. 
The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and disputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax 
reserves. However, any tax authority could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the Company's expectations, 
which could result in tax liabilities in excess of reserves. 
Risks related to our intellectual property 
The Company faces increased challenges to intellectual property rights central to its business. 
The Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights relating to its products and 
manufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Company's businesses and materially important to the Company's 
results of operations. Public policy, both within and outside the U.S., has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual 
property rights. The Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection for new products and 
technologies in the United States and other important markets or that such protections, once granted, will last as long as 
originally anticipated. 
Competitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company's owned or licensed patents and proprietary rights 
through litigation, interferences, oppositions and other proceedings, such as inter partes review (IPR) proceedings before the 
United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO). These proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as well as 
unpredictable. In addition, challenges that the Company's products infringe the patents of third parties could result in an 
injunction and/or the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the competitive position and sales of 
the products in question. 
The Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and 
biosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those 
products. In the U.S., manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may challenge the 
validity, or claim non-infringement, of innovator products through the Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, process 
with the U.S. FDA and related ANDA litigation. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), enacted in 2010, 
which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the U.S. FDA of biosimilar alternatives to innovator -developed 
biological products, also created mechanisms for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The 
IPR process with the USPTO is also being used by competitors to challenge patents asserted in litigation. 
In the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the "at-risk" launch by the 
generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the Company can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a very 
short period of time. Current legal proceedings involving the Company's patents and other intellectual property rights are 
described in Note 19 Legal proceedings —Intellectual property under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included 
in Item 8 of this Report.

Risks related to product development, regulatory approval 
and commercialization 
Significant challenges or delays in the Company's innovation, development and implementation of new products, 
technologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the Company's long-term success. 
The Company's continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products 
and services that address the evolving healthcare needs of patients, providers and consumers. Development of successful 
products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the Company's existing products lose market share 
due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products introduced within the past five years 
accounted for approximately 25% of 2023 sales. The Company cannot be certain when or whether it will be able to develop, 
license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies, whether particular product candidates will be granted 
regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the products will be commercially successful. 
The Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through collaborations, 
acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of these contexts, developing new 
products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical devices, requires significant investment of 
resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research and development programs result in commercially 
viable products. The process depends on many factors including the ability to: discern patients' and healthcare providers' 
future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies and technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure 
effective intellectual property protection; obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the 
market, successfully differentiate the Company's products from competing products and approaches to treatment. New 
products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product 
and price competition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers 
or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product can be 
adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real-world patient populations, as well as market entry of 
competitive products. 
The Company leverages the use of data science, machine learning and other forms of Al and emerging technologies across 
varying parts of its business and operations, and the introduction and incorporation of Al may result in unintended 
consequences or other new or expanded risks and liabilities. Al technology is continuously evolving, and the Al technologies we 
develop and adopt may become obsolete earlier than planned. Our investments in these technologies may not result in the 
benefits we anticipate or enable us to obtain or maintain a competitive advantage. The application of machine learning and Al in 
our business is emerging and evolving alongside new laws and regulations that may entail significant costs or ultimately limit 
our ability to continue the use of these technologies. These technologies also carry inherent risks related to data privacy and 
security further described below. 
Risks related to financial and economic market conditions 
The Company faces a variety of financial, economic, legal, social and political risks associated with conducting 
business internationally. 
The Company's extensive operations and business activity throughout the world are accompanied by certain financial, 
economic, legal, social and political risks, including those listed below. 
Foreign currency exchange: In fiscal 2023, approximately 45% of the Company's sales occurred outside of the U.S., with 
approximately 24% in Europe, 5% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 16% in the Asia-Pacific and Africa region. 
Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact the Company's revenues and expenses. While the Company 
uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its cash flows, unhedged 
exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar may 
result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of the Company's non-U.S. business 
activity are translated into U.S. dollars. 
Inflation and currency devaluation risks: The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations in economies 
experiencing high inflation rates. Specifically, the Company has accounted for operations in Argentina, Turkey and Venezuela 
as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. While the Company strives to maintain 
profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases, it 
might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation. In addition, the impact of currency devaluations in

countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the 
Company's operating results. 
Illegal importation of pharmaceutical products: The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries where 
government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the Company's sales and 
profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company operates. With the exception of limited quantities of 
prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal under current U.S. law. However, the 
volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lower-priced imports has 
grown significantly. 
Anti-bribery and other regulations: The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its international 
business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices 
Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded companies from promising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign 
officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the Company obtain or retain 
business or gain any improper advantage. The Company's business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant 
interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries outside the U.S., the healthcare providers who prescribe human 
pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities; 
therefore, the Company's interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. In 
addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company operates have laws 
and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. 
Enforcement activities under these laws could subject the Company to additional administrative and legal proceedings and 
actions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from 
healthcare programs. 
Other financial, economic, legal, social and political risks. Other risks inherent in conducting business globally include: 
• local and regional economic environments and policies in the markets that we serve, including interest rates, monetary 
policy, inflation, economic growth, recession, commodity prices, and currency controls or other limitations on the ability to 
expatriate cash; 
• protective economic policies taken by governments, such as trade protection measures, increased antitrust reporting 
requirements and enforcement activity, and import/export licensing requirements; 
• compliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements restricting the Company's 
ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market; 
• diminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions; 
• potential nationalization or expropriation of the Company's foreign assets; 
• political or social upheavals, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues; and 
• geopolitical events, including natural disasters, disruptions to markets due to war, armed conflict, terrorism, epidemics 
or pandemics. 
Due to the international nature of the Company's business, geopolitical or economic changes or events, including global 
tensions and war, could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
As described above, the Company has extensive operations and business activity throughout the world. Global tensions, 
conflict and/or war among any of the countries in which we conduct business or distribute our products may result in foreign 
currency volatility, decreased demand for our products in affected countries, and challenges to our global supply chain related 
to increased costs of materials and other inputs for our products and suppliers. Most recently, we have experienced, and 
expect to continue to experience, impacts to the Company's business resulting from the Russia-Ukraine war, rising conflict in 
the Middle East as well as increasing tensions between the U.S. and China. In response to heightened conflict, such as the 
Russia-Ukraine war, governments may impose export controls and broad financial and economic sanctions. Our business and 
operations may be further impacted by the imposition of trade protection measures or other policies adopted by any country 
that favor domestic companies and technologies over foreign competitors. Additional sanctions or other measures may be 
imposed by the global community, including but not limited to limitations on our ability to file, prosecute and maintain patents, 
trademarks and other intellectual property rights. Furthermore, in some countries, such as in Russia, action may be taken that 
allows companies and individuals to exploit inventions owned by patent holders from the United States and many other 
countries without consent or compensation and we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing the Company's 
inventions in Russia or from selling or importing products in and into Russia.

7:
Weak financial performance, failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating or disruptions in the financial markets could 
adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access to capital markets. 
We currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. 
Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based on a number of factors. 
Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, whether as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond 
our control, can increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur, reduce market capacity for our 
commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts. There can be no assurance that 
we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit 
ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our 
liquidity, capital position and access to capital markets. 
Other risks 
Our business depends on our ability to recruit and retain talented, highly skilled employees and a diverse workforce. 
Our continued growth requires us to recruit and retain talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and 
skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive and our ability to compete 
depends on our ability to hire, develop and motivate highly skilled personnel in all areas of our organization. Maintaining our 
brand and reputation, as well as a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment enables us to attract top talent. If we are 
less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and 
deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. In addition, effective succession planning is important to 
our long-term success. Any unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans or failure to ensure effective transfer of 
knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results 
of operations. 
Climate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and 
results of operations. 
Climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere 
could present risks to our operations, including an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency 
and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as a hurricane, 
tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding, may pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt the operation of our supply chain. 
The impacts of the changing climate on water resources may result in water scarcity, limiting our ability to access sufficient 
high-quality water in certain locations, which may increase operational costs. 
Concern over climate change may also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions and/or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. If such laws or regulations are 
more stringent than current legal or regulatory obligations, we may experience disruption in, or an increase in the costs 
associated with sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products, which may adversely affect our business, results of 
operations or financial condition. Further, the impacts of climate change have an influence on customer preferences, and 
failure to provide climate-friendly products could potentially result in loss of market share. 
An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact on the Company's 
business or reputation. 
To meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal information technology (IT) systems and networks, and those 
of third parties and their vendors, to process and store sensitive data, including confidential research, business plans, financial 
information, intellectual property, and personal data that may be subject to legal protection, and ensure the continuity of the 
Company's supply chain and operations. The extensive information security and cybersecurity threats, which affect companies 
globally, pose a risk to the security and availability of these systems and networks, including customer products that are 
connected to or rely on such systems and networks, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Company's 
sensitive data. The Company assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and 
response capabilities, as well as ensure the Company's third-party providers have required capabilities and controls, to address 
this risk. Because of the frequently changing attack techniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the 
attacks, there is the potential for the Company to be adversely impacted. This impact could result in reputational, competitive, 
operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action. Also, increasing use of Al could increase 
these risks. The Company maintains cybersecurity insurance in the event of an information security or cyber incident; however, 
the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial, legal, business or reputational losses.

As a result of increased global tensions, the Company expects there will continue to be, an increased risk of information 
security or cybersecurity incidents, including cyberattacks perpetrated by adversaries of countries where the Company 
maintains operations. Given the potential sophistication of these attacks, the Company may not be able to address the threat 
of information security or cybersecurity incidents proactively or implement adequate preventative measures and we may not 
be able to detect and address any such disruption or security breach promptly, or at all, which could adversely affect our 
business, results of operations or financial condition. Moreover, these threats could also impact our third-party partners 
resulting in compromise of the Company's IT systems, networks and data which could negatively affect the Company. 
A breach of privacy laws or unauthorized access, loss or misuse of personal data could have a negative impact on the 
Company's business or reputation. 
The Company is subject to privacy and data protection laws across the globe that impose broad compliance obligations on the 
collection, use, storage, access, transfer and protection of personal data. Breach of such requirements could result in 
substantial fines, penalties, private right of actions, claims and damage to our reputation and business. New privacy laws are 
expected in other territories, together with greater privacy enforcement by governmental authorities globally, particularly on 
data localization requirements and international data flows. The Company has established privacy compliance programs and 
controls that our businesses worldwide are required to comply with, but with many technology and data-driven initiatives being 
prioritized across the Company and involving multiple vendors and third parties, there are potential risks of controls imposed 
on cross border data flows, unauthorized access, and loss of personal data through internal and external threats that could 
impact our business operations and research activities. 
The Company may be unable to achieve some or all of the anticipated strategic and financial benefits following the 
separation of Kenvue Inc. (Kenvue), including with respect to the Company's remaining ownership interest. 
The Company incurred significant expenses in connection with the Kenvue separation (the Separation). In addition, the 
Company may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that are expected to result from the Separation. 
The anticipated benefits of the Separation were based on a number of assumptions, some of which may prove incorrect. The 
Company holds a 9.5% ownership interest in Kenvue. The Company cannot predict the trading price of shares of Kenvue's 
common stock and the market value of the Kenvue shares are subject to market volatility and other factors outside of the 
Company's control. The Company intends to divest its ownership interest in Kenvue, but there can be no assurance regarding 
the ultimate timing of such divestiture. Unanticipated developments could delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect the 
divestiture, including but not limited to financial market conditions. 
The Separation could result in substantial tax liability. 
The Company received a private letter ruling from the IRS as to the tax-free nature of the Separation under the U.S. Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinions of tax advisors, if the IRS 
determines that certain steps of the transaction did not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, 
the resulting tax liability to the Company and its shareholders could be substantial. The Separation may also not qualify for tax-
free treatment in other countries around the world, and as a result may trigger substantial tax liability to the Company.

Item 1B. Unresolved staff comments 
Not applicable. 
Item 1C. Cybersecurity 
Risk management and strategy 
The Company has documented cybersecurity policies and standards, assesses risks from cybersecurity threats, and monitors 
information systems for potential cybersecurity issues. To protect the Company's information systems from cybersecurity 
threats, the Company uses various security tools supporting protection, detection, and response capabilities. The Company 
maintains a cybersecurity incident response plan to help ensure a timely, consistent response to actual or attempted 
cybersecurity incidents impacting the Company. 
The Company also identifies and assesses third-party risks within the enterprise, and through the Company's use of third-party 
service providers, across a range of areas including data security and supply chain through a structured third-party risk 
management program. 
The Company maintains a formal information security training program for all employees that includes training on matters such 
as phishing and email security best practices. Employees are also required to complete mandatory training on data privacy. 
To evaluate and enhance its cybersecurity program, the Company periodically utilizes third-party experts to undertake 
maturity assessments of the Company's information security program. 
To date, the Company is not aware of any cybersecurity incident that has had or is reasonably likely to have a material impact 
on the Company's business or operations; however, because of the frequently changing attack techniques, along with the 
increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the Company to be adversely impacted. This 
impact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory 
action. Refer to the risk factor captioned An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a 
negative impact to the Company's business or reputation in Part I, Item 1A. Risk factors for additional description of 
cybersecurity risks and potential related impacts on the Company. 
Governance - management's responsibility 
The Company takes a risk-based approach to cybersecurity and has implemented cybersecurity controls designed to address 
cybersecurity threats and risks. The Chief Information Officer (CIO), who is a member of the Company's Executive Committee, 
and the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) are responsible for assessing and managing cybersecurity risks, including the 
prevention, mitigation, detection, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents. 
The Company's CISO, in coordination with the CIO, is responsible for leading the Company's cybersecurity program and 
management of cybersecurity risk. The current CISO has over twenty-five years of experience in information security, and his 
background includes technical experience, strategy and architecture focused roles, cyber and threat experience, and various 
leadership roles. 
Governance - board oversight 
The Company's Board of Directors oversees the overall risk management process, including cybersecurity risks, directly and 
through its committees. The Regulatory Compliance & Sustainability Committee (RCSC) of the board is primarily responsible 
for oversight of risk from cybersecurity threats and oversees compliance with applicable laws, regulations and Company 
policies related to, among others, privacy and cybersecurity. 
RCSC meetings include discussions of specific risk areas throughout the year including, among others, those relating to 
cybersecurity. The CISO provides at least two updates each year to RCSC on cybersecurity matters. These reports include an 
overview of the cybersecurity threat landscape, key cybersecurity initiatives to improve the Company's risk posture, changes 
in the legal and regulatory landscape relative to cybersecurity, and overviews of certain cybersecurity incidents that have 
occurred within the Company and within the industry.

Item 7. Management's discussion and analysis of results of 
operations and financial condition 
Organization and business segments 
Description of the company and business segments 
Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately131,900 employees worldwide engaged in the 
research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts 
business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being. 
The Company is organized into two business segments: Innovative Medicine and MedTech. The Innovative Medicine segment is 
focused on the following therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary 
Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, 
wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use. The MedTech segment includes a broad 
portfolio of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional Solutions and Vision fields. These products are 
distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, 
eye care professionals and clinics. 
The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations 
and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Innovative 
Medicine and MedTech business segments. 
In all of its product lines, the Company competes with other companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. 
Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. 
Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, 
is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual 
property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company's success in all areas of its business. The 
competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. 
Management's objectives 
With "Our Credo" as the foundation, the Company's purpose is to blend heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly impact 
health for humanity. The Company, believes health is everything. The Company's strength in healthcare innovation empowers us 
to build a world where complex diseases are prevented, treated, and cured, where treatments are smarter and less invasive, 
and solutions are personal. Through the Company's expertise in Innovative Medicine and MedTech, the Company is uniquely 
positioned to innovate across the full spectrum of healthcare solutions today to deliver the breakthroughs of tomorrow, and 
profoundly impact health for humanity. 
New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2023 sales. In 2023, $15.1 billion was 
invested in research and development reflecting management's commitment to create life-enhancing innovations and to create 
value through partnerships that will profoundly impact of health for humanity. 
A critical driver of the Company's success is the diversity of its 131,900 employees worldwide. Employees are empowered and 
inspired to lead with Our Credo and purpose as guides. This allows every employee to use the Company's reach and size to 
advance the Company's purpose, and to also lead with agility and urgency. Leveraging the extensive resources across the 
enterprise enables the Company to innovate and execute with excellence. This ensures the Company can remain focused on 
addressing the unmet needs of society every day and invest for an enduring impact, ultimately delivering value to its patients, 
consumers and healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders.

Volume 6.8% 8.3% 
Price 0.6 (1.8) 
Currency (0.9) (4.9) 
Total 6.5% 1.6% 
The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the worldwide sales growth was a positive impact of 1.5% in 2023 and no 
impact in 2022. 
Sales by U.S. companies were $46.4 billion in 2023 and $42.0 billion in 2022. This represents increases of 10.6% in 2023 
and 3.3% in 2022. Sales by international companies were $38.7 billion in 2023 and $38.0 billion in 2022. This represents an 
increase of 1.9% in 2023 and a decrease of 0.2% in 2022. 
The five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 4.7%, 5.2% and 4.1%, respectively. 
The ten-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 4.2%, 5.7% and 2.6%, 
respectively. 
In 2023, sales by companies in Europe experienced a decline of 1.2% as compared to the prior year, which included an 
operational decline of 2.2% and a positive currency impact of 1.0%. In fiscal 2023, the net impact of the Covid-19 Vaccine and

Immunology products achieved sales of $18.1 billion in 2023, representing an increase of 6.6% as compared to the prior year. 
Increased sales of STELARA (ustekinumab) were primarily driven by patient mix, market growth, and continued strength in 
Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Growth of TREMFYA(guselkumab) was due to market growth, continued strength in PsO/PsA 
(Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis) and patient mix. Additionally, SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA growth was driven by growth outside 
the U.S. Lower sales of REMICADE (infliximab) were due to biosimilar competition. 
Biosimilar versions of REMICADE have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United States and 
additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will result in a further 
reduction in sales of REMICADE. 
Sales of STELARA in the United States were approximately $7.0 billion in fiscal 2023. Third parties have filed abbreviated 
Biologics License Applications with the FDA seeking approval to market biosimilar versions of STELARA. The Company has 
settled certain litigation under the Biosimilar Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. As a result of these settlements 
and other agreements with separate third parties, the Company does not anticipate the launch of a biosimilar version of 
STELARA until January 1, 2025 in the United States. 
Infectious disease products sales were $4.4 billion in 2023, a decline of 18.9% as compared to the prior year primarily driven by 
a decline in COVID-19 vaccine revenue and loss of exclusivity of PREZISTA. 
Neuroscience products sales were $7.1 billion in 2023, representing an increase of 3.6% as compared to the prior year. The 
growth of SPRAVATO (esketamine) was driven by ongoing launches as well as increased physician confidence and patient 
demand. Growth was partially offset by declines in RISPERDAL/RISPERDAL CONSTA and the paliperidone long-acting 
injectables outside the U.S. due to the XEPLION loss of exclusivity in the European Union. 
Oncology products achieved sales of $17.7 billion in 2023, representing an increase of 10.5% as compared to the prior year. 
Sales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) were driven by continued share gains in all regions and market growth. Growth of 
ERLEADA (apalutamide) was due to continued share gains and market growth in Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate 
Cancer. Sales of CARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene autoleucel) were driven by the ongoing launch, share gains and capacity 
improvement. Additionally, sales from the launch of TECVAYLI (teclistamab-cqyv) and TALVEY (talquetamab-tgvs), included in 
Other Oncology, contributed to the growth. Growth was partially offset by ZYTIGA (abiraterone acetate) due to loss of 
exclusivity and IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) due to global competitive pressures. 
Pulmonary Hypertension products sales were $3.8 billion, representing an increase of 11.6% as compared to the prior year. 
Sales growth was due to favorable patient mix, share gains and market growth from UPTRAVI (selexipag) and OPSUMIT 
(macitentan) partially offset by declines in Other Pulmonary Hypertension. 
Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $3.7 billion, a decline of 5.5% as compared to the prior year. The 
decline of XARELTO (rivaroxaban) sales was primarily driven by unfavorable patient mix and access changes. 
The Company maintains a policy that no end customer will be permitted direct delivery of product to a location other than the 
billing location. This policy impacts contract pharmacy transactions involving non-grantee 340B covered entities for most of 
the Company's drugs, subject to multiple exceptions. Both grantee and non-grantee covered entities can maintain certain 
contract pharmacy arrangements under policy exceptions. The Company has been and will continue to offer 340B discounts to 
covered entities on all of its covered outpatient drugs, and it believes its policy will improve its ability to identify inappropriate 
duplicate discounts and diversion prohibited by the 340B statute. The 340B Drug Pricing Program is a U.S. federal 
government program requiring drug manufacturers to provide significant discounts on covered outpatient drugs to covered 
entities. This policy had discount implications which positively impacted sales to customers in 2023.

The Surgery franchise sales were $10.0 billion in 2023, representing an increase of 3.6% from 2022. The growth in Advanced 
Surgery was primarily driven by Biosurgery global procedure growth and strength of the portfolio as well as uptake of new 
products in Endocutters and Energy. The growth was partially offset by competitive pressures and volume-based procurement 
impacts in Endocutters and Energy. The growth in General Surgery was primarily driven by increased procedures coupled with 
technology penetration and benefits from the differentiated Wound Closure portfolio. 
The Orthopaedics franchise sales were $8.9 billion in 2023, representing an increase of 4.1% from 2022. The growth in hips 
reflects global procedure growth and continued strength of the portfolio partially offset by volume-based procurement 
impacts and Russia sanctions. The growth in knees was primarily driven by procedures, benefits from recent product additions 
to the ATTUNE portfolio and pull through related to the VELYS Robotic assisted solution. This was partially offset by stocking 
dynamics, primarily outside the U.S. The growth in Trauma was driven by global procedures and the adoption of recently 
launched products. This was partially offset by volume-based procurement impacts. The growth in Spine, Sports & Other was 
primarily driven by Digital Solutions, Shoulders, Sports and Craniomaxillofacial products partially offset by Russia sanctions 
and supply constraints, primarily outside the U.S. 
The Interventional Solutions franchise achieved sales of $6.4 billion in 2023, representing an increase of 47.7% from 2022, 
which includes sales from Abiomed acquired on December 22, 2022. Electrophysiology grew by double digits due to global 
procedure growth, new product performance and commercial execution. This was partially offset by the impacts of volume-
based procurement in China. Abiomed sales reflect the strength of all commercialized regions and continued adoption of 
Impella 5.5 and Impella RP. 
The Vision franchise achieved sales of $5.1 billion in 2023, representing an increase of 4.6% from 2022. The Contact Lenses/ 
Other growth was primarily driven by the continued strong performance in the ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family including recent 
launches and commercial execution. This was partially offset by impacts of U.S. stocking dynamics, Russia sanctions, impacts 
from strategic portfolio decisions and supply challenges. The Surgical operational growth was primarily driven by cataract 
procedure growth, continued strength of recent innovations and reduction of prior year stocking outside the U.S. This was 
partially offset by softer Refractive and premium IOL markets and Russia sanctions.

Selling, Marketing and Administrative expense: 
Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses decreased slightly as a percent to sales driven by: 
• Leveraging in Selling and Marketing expenses both the Innovative Medicine and MedTech businesses 
partially offset by 
• An increase in administrative costs 
Research and Development Expense: 
Research and development expense by segment of business was as follows: 
2023 2022 
(Dollars in Millions) Amount % of Sales* Amount % of Sales* 
Innovative Medicine $11,963 21.8% $11,642 22.1% 
MedTech 3,122 10.3 2,493 9.1 
Total research and development expense $15,085 17.7% $14,135 17.7% 
Percent increase/(decrease) over the prior year 6.7 % (1.0%) 
*As a percent to segment sales 
Research and development activities represent a significant part of the Company's business. These expenditures relate to the 
processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, upfront payments and developmental milestones, improving 
existing products, as well as ensuring product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains 
committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. 
Research and Development was flat as a percent to sales primarily driven by: 
• Higher milestone payments in the Innovative Medicine business 
• Acquired in-process research & development asset from the Laminar acquisition in the MedTech business in the fiscal 
year 2023 
offset by 
• Portfolio prioritization in the Innovative Medicine business 
In-Process Research and Development Impairments (IPR&D): In the fiscal year 2023, the Company recorded a charge of 
approximately $0.3 billion which included $0.2 billion related to market dynamics associated with a non-strategic asset (M710) 
acquired as part of the acquisition of Momenta Pharmaceuticals in 2020, In the fiscal year 2022, the Company recorded an 
intangible asset impairment charge of approximately $0.8 billion related to an in-process research and development asset, 
bermekimab (JnJ-77474462), an investigational drug for the treatment of Atopic Dermatitis (AD) and Hidradenitis Suppurativa 
(HS). Additional information regarding efficacy of the AD indication and HS indication became available which led the Company 
to the decision to terminate the development of bermekimab for both AD and HS. The Company acquired all rights to 
bermekimab from XBiotech, Inc. in the fiscal year 2020. 
Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses 
related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, 
Inc. (JJDC), changes in the fair value of securities, investment (income)/loss related to employee benefit programs, gains and 
losses on divestitures, certain transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition and divestiture related costs, litigation 
accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income.

Other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2023 was unfavorable by $5.8 billion as compared to the prior year primarily 
due to the following: 
(Dollars in Billions)(Income)/Expense 2023 2022 Change 
Litigation related() $6.9 0.9 6.0 
Changes in the fair value of securities (2) 0.6 0.7 (0.1)

Acquisition, Integration and Divestiture related(3) 0.3 0.2 0.1 
Employee benefit plan related (1.4) (1.2) (0.2) 
Other (0.2) (0.5) 0.3 
Total Other (Income) Expense, Net $6.6 0.8 5.8 
(1) 
(2) 
(3) 2023 was primarily related to the approximately $7.0 billion charge for talc (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for 
more details) and favorable intellectual property related litigation settlements of approximately $0.3 billion. 2022 was primarily related to 
pelvic mesh. 
The fiscal 2023 includes $0.4 billion related to the unfavorable change in the fair value of the remaining stake in Kenvue and $0.4 billion 
related to the partial impairment of Idorsia convertible debt and the change in the fair value of the Idorsia equity securities held. 
2023 primarily related to the impairment of Ponvory and one-time integration costs related to the acquisition of Abiomed. 2022 was 
primarily costs related to the acquisition of Abiomed. 
Interest (Income) Expense: Interest income in the fiscal year 2023 was $1.3 billion as compared to interest income of $0.5 
billion in the fiscal year 2022 primarily due to higher rates of interest earned on cash balances. Interest expense in the fiscal 
year 2023 was $0.8 billion as compared to interest expense of $0.3 billion in the fiscal year 2022 primarily due to higher 
interest rates on debt balances. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $22.9 billion at the end of 2023, and 
averaged $22.6 billion as compared to the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total of $22.3 billion and 
$26.9 billion average balance in 2022. The total debt balance at the end of 2023 was $29.3 billion with an average debt 
balance of $34.5 billion as compared to $39.6 billion at the end of 2022 and an average debt balance of $36.7 billion. The 
lower average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was primarily due to the acquisition of Abiomed in late 
December of 2022. The lower average debt balance was primarily due to the repayment of commercial paper.

Innovative Medicine segment: 
In 2023, the Innovative Medicine segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 33.3% versus 29.8% in 2022. The 
increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily driven by the following: 
• Lower one-time COVID-19 Vaccine related exit costs of $0.7 billion in 2023 versus $1.5 billion in 2022 
• Lower In-process research & development impairments of $0.2 billion in 2023 versus $0.8 billion in 2022 
• Unfavorable changes in the fair value of securities in 2023 of $0.4 billion as compared to $0.7 billion in 2022 
• Lower litigation related expense of $0.2 billion 
• Leveraging in selling and marketing expenses 
• R&D Portfolio prioritization 
partially offset by 
• Restructuring charges of $0.5 billion in 2023 versus $0.1 billion in 2022 
• Impairment of Ponvory in 2023 
• Higher milestone payments in 2023 
MedTech segment: 
In 2023, the MedTech segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 15.4% versus 16.2% in 2022. The decrease in the 
income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily driven by the following: 
• Higher amortization expense of $0.5 billion in 2023 related to Abiomed 
• Expense of $0.4 billion for an acquired in process research and development asset from the Laminar acquisition in 2023 
• Commodity inflation in 2023 
partially offset by 
• Income from litigation settlements of $0.1 billion in 2023 versus expense of $0.6 billion in 2022 
• Lower integration/acquisition costs related to Abiomed of $0.2 billion in 2023 versus $0.3 billion in 2022 
• Leveraging in selling and marketing expenses in 2023 
Restructuring: In the fiscal year 2023, the Company completed a prioritization of its research and development (R&D) 
investment within the Innovative Medicine segment to focus on the most promising medicines with the greatest benefit to 
patients. This resulted in the exit of certain programs within therapeutic areas. The R&D program exits are primarily in 
infectious diseases and vaccines including the discontinuation of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) adult vaccine program, 
hepatitis and HIV development. The pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $0.5 billion in the fiscal year 2023, of which 
$449 million was recorded in Restructuring and $30 million was recorded in Cost of products sold on the Consolidated 
Statement of Earnings, included the termination of partnered and non-partnered program costs and asset impairments. 
In the fiscal year 2023, the Company initiated a restructuring program of its Orthopaedics franchise within the MedTech 
segment to streamline operations by exiting certain markets, product lines and distribution network arrangements. The pre-tax 
restructuring expense of $0.3 billion in the fiscal year 2023, of which $40 million was recorded in Restructuring and $279 
million was recorded in Cost of products sold on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, primarily included inventory and 
instrument charges related to market and product exits. 
In 2022, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.4 billion related to a restructuring program of its Global Supply Chain. 
The Global Supply Chain program was announced in the second quarter of 2018 and was completed in the fiscal fourth quarter 
of 2022. 
See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs.

Provision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 11.5% in 2023 and 
15.4% in 2022. 
On December 15, 2022, the European Union (EU) Member States formally adopted the EU's Pillar Two Directive, which 
generally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, as established by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) Pillar Two Framework that was supported by over 130 countries worldwide. As of December 31, 2023, 
several EU and non-EU countries have enacted Pillar 2 legislation with an initial effective date of January 1, 2024, with other 
aspects of the law effective in 2025 or later. The Company is estimating that as result of this legislation the 2024 effective 
tax rate will increase by approximately 1.5% or 150 basis points compared to fiscal 2023. Further legislation, guidance and 
regulations that may be issued in fiscal 2024, as well as other business events, may impact this estimate. 
For discussion related to the fiscal 2023 provision for taxes refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

As of December 31, 2023, the Company's notes payable and long-term debt was in excess of cash, cash equivalents and 
marketable securities. As of December 31, 2023, the net debt position was $6.4 billion as compared to the prior year of $17.4 
billion. The debt balance at the end of 2023 was $29.3 billion as compared to $39.6 billion in 2022. Considering recent market 
conditions, the Company has re-evaluated its operating cash flows and liquidity profile and does not foresee any significant 
incremental risk. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, 
borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to 
provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the Company's remaining balance to be paid on the agreement 
to settle opioid litigation for approximately $2.1 billion and the establishment of the approximately $9 billion reserve for talc 
matters (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In addition, the Company monitors the 
global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. 
On May 8, 2023, Kenvue, completed an initial public offering (the IPO) resulting in the issuance of 198,734,444 shares of its 
common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Kenvue Common Stock), at an initial public offering of $22.00 per share for net 
proceeds of $4.2 billion. The excess of the net proceeds from the IPO over the net book value of the Johnson & Johnson 
divested interest was $2.5 billion and was recorded to additional paid-in capital. As of the closing of the IPO, Johnson & 
Johnson owned approximately 89.6% of the total outstanding shares of Kenvue Common Stock and at July 2, 2023, the non-
controlling interest of $1.3 billion associated with Kenvue was reflected in equity attributable to non-controlling interests in the 
consolidated balance sheet. 
On August 23, 2023, Johnson & Johnson completed the disposition of an additional 80.1% ownership of Kenvue Common 
Stock through an exchange offer, which resulted in Johnson & Johnson acquiring 190,955,436 shares of the Company's 
common stock in exchange for 1,533,830,450 shares of Kenvue Common Stock. The $31.4 billion of Johnson & Johnson 
common stock received in the exchange offer is recorded in Treasury stock. Following the exchange offer, the Company owns 
9.5% of the total outstanding shares of Kenvue Common Stock that was recorded in other assets within continuing operations 
at the fair market value of $4.3 billion as of August 23, 2023 and $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2023. 
Johnson & Johnson divested net assets of $11.6 billion as of August 23, 2023, and the accumulated other comprehensive loss 
attributable to the Consumer Health business at that date was $4.3 billion. Additionally, at the date of the exchange offer,

Johnson & Johnson decreased the non-controlling interest by $1.2 billion to record the deconsolidation of Kenvue. 
This resulted in a gain on the exchange offer of $21.0 billion that was recorded in Net earnings from discontinued operations, 
net of taxes in the consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal third quarter of 2023. This one-time gain includes a gain 
of $2.8 billion on the Kenvue Common Stock retained by Johnson & Johnson. The gain on the exchange offer qualifies as a tax-
free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
On September 14, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, 
authorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company's Common Stock. In the fiscal year 2022, 
approximately $2.5 billion was repurchased under the program. In the fiscal year 2023, $2.5 billion has been repurchased and 
the repurchase program was completed. 
The following table summarizes the Company's material contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of 
December 31, 2023: To satisfy these obligations, the Company intends to use cash from operations.

Financing and market risk 
The Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, 
the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and 
liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these 
contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the 
December 31, 2023 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company's forward contracts by $0.1 billion. 
Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 31, 2023 market rates would decrease the unrealized 
value of the Company's forward contracts by $0.1 billion. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be 
offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings 
and cash flows. 
The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in 
foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates 
on the Company's interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the 
Company's swap contracts by approximately $1.6 billion. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract 
would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated 
cash flows. 
The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy 
of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counterparties to these 
contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counterparty. 
Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company entered into credit support agreements (CSA) with certain 
derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. See 
Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on credit support agreements. 
The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. 
The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate 
securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the 
Company's interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and 
current marketable securities by less than $0.8 billion. 
The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2023, the Company 
secured a new 364-day Credit Facility of $10 billion, which expires on September 5, 2024. The Company early terminated the 
additional 364-day revolving Credit Facility of $10 billion, which had an expiration of November 21, 2023. Interest charged on 
borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Reference Rate or 
other applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material. 
Total borrowings at the end of 2023 and 2022 were $29.3 billion and $39.6 billion, respectively. The decrease in the debt 
balance was due to the repayment of commercial paper. In 2023, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of 
debt) was $6.4 billion compared to net debt of $17.4 billion in 2022. Total debt represented 30.0% of total capital 
(shareholders' equity and total debt) in 2023 and 34.0% of total capital in 2022. Shareholders' equity per share at the end of 
2023 was $28.57 compared to $29.39 at year-end 2022. 
A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Dividends 
The Company increased its dividend in 2023 for the 61st consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $4.70 per share in 2023 
and $4.45 per share in 2022. 
On January 2, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.19 per share, payable on March 5, 2024 to 
shareholders of record as of February 20, 2024.

Other information 
Critical accounting policies and estimates 
Management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company's 
consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the 
U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that 
affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may 
not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and 
estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company's operating results and financial condition. These key 
accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived 
assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting 
for stock based awards. 
Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract 
with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's 
global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, 
coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for as variable 
consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. 
Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well 
as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, 
historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The 
Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and 
other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information. 
Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales 
or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of 
the accounting for sales return accruals. 
Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in 
specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a 
percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company's accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to 
customers for returned goods. The Company's sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP 
guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales 
returns in the Innovative Medicine segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the 
MedTech segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory 
for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been less than 1.0% of annual net trade sales during 
the fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021. 
Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances are recorded in the same period as related sales and include volume-
based sales incentive programs. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive 
period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be 
deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative 
arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers. Profit-share payments were less than 2.0% of the 
total revenues in fiscal year 2023 and less than 3.0% of the total revenues in fiscal year 2022 and 2021 are included in sales to 
customers. 
In addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. Amounts 
due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the 
relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance 
period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations. 
Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not 
anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to 
assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact.

Income Taxes: Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results 
of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The 
Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws 
and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities. 
The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a 
recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position 
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material 
effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 
The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its 
international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to 
January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The 
Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later 
date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these 
amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.5 billion under currently 
enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates. This amount does not include the possible benefit of 
U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this cost. 
See Note 1 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes. 
Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings 
and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management's judgment 
as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through 
a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the 
insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. 
The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a 
loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.

See Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and 
legal proceedings. 
Long-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in economic 
conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company's property, 
plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may 
not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges. 
Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined 
contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions 
for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases, healthcare cost trend rates 
and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these rates. 
Stock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity 
instruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of 
grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model 
and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the service period. The input assumptions 
used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield. For 
performance share units, the fair market value is calculated for the two component goals at the date of grant: adjusted 
operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. The fair values for the earnings per share goal of each 
performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, 
discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the 
relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo 
valuation model. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Economic and market factors 
The Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers 
and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of healthcare. In response to these concerns, the Company has 
a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2013 - 2023, in the U.S., the weighted average compound 
annual growth rate of the Company's net price increases for healthcare products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, 
hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI). 
The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The 
Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on 
worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in 
Argentina, Venezuela and Turkey (beginning in the fiscal second quarter of 2022) as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year 
cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact to the Company's results in the period. In the 
face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity 
improvements and periodic price increases. 
In December 2023, the Argentine government devalued the peso by approximately 50%. During 2023, the Company recorded 
a charge of approximately $130 million related to operations in Argentina due to the application of highly inflationary 
accounting. As of December 31, 2023, the Company's Argentine subsidiaries represented less than 1.0% of the Company's 
consolidated assets, liabilities, revenues and profits from continuing operations; therefore, the effect of a change in the 
exchange rate is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's 2024 full-year results. 
In July 2023, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen) filed litigation against the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services challenging the constitutionality of the Inflation Reduction 
Act's (IRA) Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. The litigation requests a declaration that the IRA violates Janssen's 
rights under the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and therefore that Janssen is not subject to 
the IRA's mandatory pricing scheme. 
Russia-Ukraine War 
Although the long-term implications of Russia's invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time, the financial impact of 
the conflict in the fiscal year 2023, including accounts receivable or inventory reserves, was not material. As of and for each of 
the fiscal years ending December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, the business of the Company's Russian subsidiaries 
represented less than 1% of the Company's consolidated assets and represented 1% of revenues. The Company does not 
maintain Ukraine subsidiaries subsequent to the Kenvue separation. 
In early March of 2022, the Company took steps to suspend all advertising, enrollment in clinical trials, and any additional 
investment in Russia. The Company continues to supply products relied upon by patients for healthcare purposes. 
Conflict in the Middle East 
Although the long-term implications of Israel's conflict are difficult to predict at this time, the financial impact of the conflict in 
the fiscal year 2023, including accounts receivable or inventory reserves, was not material. As of and for the fiscal year ending 
December 31, 2023, the business of the Company's Israel subsidiaries represented 1% of the Company's consolidated assets 
and represented less than 1% of revenues. 
The Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to 
all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2023 would have increased or decreased the 
translation of foreign sales by approximately $0.4 billion and net income by approximately $0.2 billion. 
Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or 
decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose 
more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned 
in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax 
assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would 
result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company's Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors 
these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and 
any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. 
The Company faces various worldwide healthcare changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include 
healthcare cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions, pricing and reimbursement of 
healthcare products. 
Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying medical 
procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing healthcare insurance 
coverage may continue to impact the Company's businesses.

The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated 
New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the U.S. FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage 
and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company's key 
pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not 
successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at 
issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those 
products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one 
or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even 
though one or more valid patents are in place. 
Legal proceedings 
Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, 
intellectual property, commercial, employment, indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal 
proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. 
The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will 
be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has determined 
that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has 
accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted 
based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25, Contingencies. For these and other 
litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to 
estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result 
from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions 
including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors 
including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and 
legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; 
there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of 
potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and 
counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been 
rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be 
reasonably estimated. 
In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the 
ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a 
material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more 
of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash 
flows for that period. 
See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information regarding 
legal proceedings. 
Common stock 
The Company's Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ. As of February 9, 2024, there 
were 118,772 record holders of Common Stock of the Company.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
1. Summary of significant accounting policies 
Principles of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company). 
Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding. 
Percentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures. 
Description of the company and business segments 
The Company has approximately 131,900 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and 
sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world 
and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being. 
Kenvue IPO/separation and discontinued operations 
On May 8, 2023, Kenvue, completed an initial public offering (the IPO) resulting in the issuance of 198,734,444 shares of its 
common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Kenvue Common Stock"), at an initial public offering of $22.00 per share for 
net proceeds of $4.2 billion. The excess of the net proceeds from the IPO over the net book value of the Johnson & Johnson 
divested interest was $2.5 billion and was recorded to additional paid-in capital. As of the closing of the IPO, Johnson & 
Johnson owned approximately 89.6% of the total outstanding shares of Kenvue Common Stock and at July 2, 2023, the non-
controlling interest of $1.3 billion associated with Kenvue was reflected in equity attributable to non-controlling interests in the 
consolidated balance sheet in the fiscal second quarter of 2023. 
On August 23, 2023, Johnson & Johnson completed the disposition of an additional 80.1% ownership of the shares of Kenvue 
through an exchange offer. Following the exchange offer, the Company owns 9.5% of the shares of Kenvue which are 
accounted for as an equity investment carried at fair value within continuing operations. The historical results of the Consumer 
Health business (which previously represented the Consumer Health business segment) are reflected as discontinued 
operations in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements through the date of the exchange offer (see Note 21 for 
additional details). Unless otherwise indicated, the information in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements refer only 
to Johnson & Johnson's continuing operations. 
Business segments 
Following the completion of the exchange offer, the Company is organized into two business segments: Innovative Medicine 
and MedTech. The Innovative Medicine segment is focused on the following therapeutic areas, including Immunology, 
Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in 
this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for 
prescription use. The MedTech segment includes a broad portfolio of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional 
Solutions and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the 
professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. 
New accounting standards 
Recently adopted accounting standards 
ASU 2022-04: Liabilities -Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50) - Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations 
The Company adopted the standard as of the beginning of fiscal year 2023, which requires that a buyer in a supplier finance 
program disclose additional information about the program for financial statement users. 
The Company has agreements for supplier finance programs with third-party financial institutions. These programs provide 
participating suppliers the ability to finance payment obligations from the Company with the third-party financial institutions. 
The Company is not a party to the arrangements between the suppliers and the third-party financial institutions. The 
Company's obligations to its suppliers, including amounts due, and scheduled payment dates (which have general payment 
terms of 90 days), are not affected by a participating supplier's decision to participate in the program.

presented as Accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Recently issued accounting standards 
Not adopted as of December 31, 2023 
ASU 2023-07: Segment Reporting (Topic 280) — Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures 
This update requires expanded annual and interim disclosures for significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to 
the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss. This update will be 
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and is to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented in 
the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted. As this accounting standard only impacts disclosures, it will not have a 
material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 
ASU 2023-09: Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures 
This update standardizes categories for the effective tax rate reconciliation, requires disaggregation of income taxes and 
additional income tax-related disclosures. This update is required to be effective for the Company for fiscal periods beginning 
after December 15, 2024. As this accounting standard only impacts disclosures, it will not have a material impact on the 
Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Cash equivalents 
The Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as 
cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of 
purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions 
that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash primarily in government securities and 
obligations, corporate debt securities, money market funds and reverse repurchase agreements (RRAs). 
RRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less than 102% of 
their value. The Company does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to sell or repledge the 
associated collateral. The Company has a policy that the collateral has at least an A (or equivalent) credit rating. The Company 
utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure that collateral received is maintained at102% of 
the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase are 
classified as marketable securities. 
Investments 
Investments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses are reported 
in earnings. Investments classified as available-for-sale debt securities are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains 
and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities available for 
current operations are classified as current assets; otherwise, they are classified as long term. Management determines the 
appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such 
determination at each balance sheet date. The Company reviews its investments for impairment and adjusts these investments 
to fair value through earnings, as required. 
Property, plant and equipment and depreciation 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation over the 
estimated useful lives of the assets: 
Building and building equipment 
Land and leasehold improvements 
Machinery and equipment 30 years 
10 - 20 years 
2 -13 years 
The Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when 
incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are 
amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range from 3 to 8 years. 
The Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When certain events or 
changes in operating or economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the

carrying value of these assets. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between 
the asset's fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company will estimate fair value using 
a discounted value of estimated future cash flows. 
Revenue recognition* 
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are 
satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms 
are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product 
returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for as variable consideration and 
recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability is recognized within Accrued rebates, returns, and promotions on the consolidated 
balance sheet. 
Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well 
as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, 
historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. A 
significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of the Company's pharmaceutical products within the U.S., 
primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $11.5 billion and $9.6 billion as of 
December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, respectively. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of 
products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as 
internally generated information. 
Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales 
or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of 
the accounting for sales return accruals. 
Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in 
specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a 
percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company's accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to 
customers for returned goods. The Company's sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP 
guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales 
returns in the Innovative Medicine segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the 
MedTech segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory 
for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been less than 1.0% of annual net trade sales during 
each of the fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021. 
Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances are recorded in the same period as related sales and include volume-
based sales incentive programs. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive 
period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be 
deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative 
arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers. Profit-share payments were less than 2.0% of the 
total revenues in fiscal year 2023 and less than 3.0% of the total revenues in the fiscal years 2022 and 2021 and are included in 
sales to customers. 
See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue. 
Shipping and handling 
Shipping and handling costs incurred were $0.9 billion, $0.8 billion and $0.8 billion in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, 
respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue received for shipping 
and handling is less than 1.0% of sales to customers for all periods presented. 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method. 
Intangible assets and goodwill 
The authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be assessed annually 
for impairment. The Company completed its annual impairment test for 2023 in the fiscal fourth quarter. Future impairment

tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted. Purchased in-process research and 
development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying project is completed, at which point the 
intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived intangible asset. If warranted the purchased in-process research and 
development could be written off or partially impaired depending on the underlying program. 
Intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment 
when warranted by economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and Goodwill. 
Financial instruments 
As required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is the exit 
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement 
determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature 
establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value, with Level 1 having the highest priority 
and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other 
comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of 
hedge transaction. 
The Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy 
includes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy are: 
(1) minimize foreign currency exposure's impact on the Company's financial performance; (2) protect the Company's cash flow 
from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial instruments; and (4) manage 
the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional information on Financial Instruments. 
Leases 
The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by establishing if the contract conveys the 
right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Right of 
Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities for operating leases are included in Other assets, Accrued liabilities, and Other liabilities 
on the consolidated balance sheet. The ROU Assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease 
liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Commitments under finance leases are not 
significant, and are included in Property, plant and equipment, Loans and notes payable, and Long-term debt on the 
consolidated balance sheet. 
ROU Assets and Lease Liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of all minimum 
lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at 
commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, when the implicit rate is not readily determinable. 
Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options are included in the lease term when it is 
reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term. The Company has elected the following policy elections on adoption: use of portfolio approach on leases 
of assets under master service agreements, exclusion of short term leases on the balance sheet, and not separating lease and 
non-lease components. 
The Company primarily has operating lease for space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and data processing equipment. The 
ROU asset pertaining to leases from continuing operation was $1.0 billion in both fiscal years 2023 and 2022. The lease liability 
from continuing operations was $1.1 billion in both fiscal years 2023 and 2022. The operating lease costs from continuing 
operations were $0.2 billion in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease 
liabilities from continuing operations were $0.2 billion in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021. 
Product liability 
Accruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred 
and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and actuarially determined estimates 
where applicable. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available. The Company accrues an 
estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably 
estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual 
until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.

The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self 
insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be 
reasonably estimated. 
Research and development 
Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development. 
Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are 
expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval 
are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts capitalized for such payments are 
included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization. 
The Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, to 
develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or more) parties 
who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial 
success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by one or more parties, including research and 
development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these collaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit 
share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. 
Amounts due from collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research 
and development expense because the performance of contract development services is not central to the Company's 
operations. In general, the income statement presentation for these collaborations is as follows: 
Nature/Type of Collaboration Statement of Earnings Presentation 
Third-party sale of product & profit share payments received Sales to customers 
Royalties/milestones paid to collaborative partner (post-
regulatory approval)* 
Royalties received from collaborative partner 
Upfront payments & milestones paid to collaborative partner 
(pre-regulatory approval) 
Research and development payments to 
collaborative partner 
Research and development payments received from 
collaborative partner or government entity Cost of products sold 
Other income (expense), net 
Research and development expense 
Research and development expense 
Reduction of Research and development expense 
* Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the useful life. 
For all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5% of the total annual consolidated 
research and development expense. 
The Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners including 
XARELTO, co-developed with Bayer HealthCare AG and IMBRUVICA, developed in collaboration and co-marketed with 
Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company. 
Separately, the Company has a number of licensing arrangements for products and compounds including DARZALEX, licensed 
from Genmab A/S. 
Advertising 
Costs associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and administrative 
expenses. Advertising expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and Internet advertising, were $0.5 
billion, $0.7 billion and $1.2 billion in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
Income taxes 
Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any 
difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company

;:
estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates 
may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. 
The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP which prescribes a 
recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position 
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material 
effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 
In 2017, the United States enacted into law new U.S. tax legislation, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This law included 
provisions for a comprehensive overhaul of the corporate income tax code, including a reduction of the statutory corporate 
tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective on January 1, 2018. The TCJA included a provision for a tax on all previously undistributed 
earnings of U.S. companies located in foreign jurisdictions. Undistributed earnings in the form of cash and cash equivalents 
were taxed at a rate of 15.5% and all other earnings were taxed at a rate of 8.0%. This tax is payable over 8 years and will not 
accrue interest. These payments began in 2018 and will continue through 2025. The remaining balance at the end of the 2023 
was approximately $4.5 billion, of which $2.5 billion is classified as noncurrent and reflected as "Long-term taxes payable" on 
the Company's balance sheet. 
The TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). GILTI is described as the excess of a 
U.S. shareholder's total net foreign income over a deemed return on tangible assets, as provided by the TCJA. In January 2018, 
the FASB issued guidance that allows companies to elect as an accounting policy whether to record the tax effects of GILTI in 
the period the tax liability is generated (i.e., "period cost") or provide for deferred tax assets and liabilities related to basis 
differences that exist and are expected to effect the amount of GILTI inclusion in future years upon reversal (i.e., "deferred 
method"). The Company has elected to account for GILTI under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts recorded are 
based on the evaluation of temporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred in future periods. 
The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its 
international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 
1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company 
intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to 
repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The 
Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.5 billion under currently enacted tax 
laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates. This amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign 
tax credits, which may substantially offset this cost. 
See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes. 
,Jet earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average 
number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could 
occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock method. 
Use of estimates 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the 
U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used when 
accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives, product liabilities, income taxes, withholding taxes, 
depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability valuations. Actual results may or 
may not differ from those estimates. 
The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a 
loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate 
in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued. 
Annual closing date 
The Company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of December. 
Normally each fiscal year consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years the fiscal year consists of 53 weeks, and therefore 
includes additional shipping days, as was the case in fiscal year 2020, and will be the case again in fiscal year 2026.

6. Fair value measurements 
The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows, primarily 
related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany products and third-party purchases of materials 
denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency risk primarily 
related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. 
Additionally, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed rate 
borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps and 
forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company uses forward foreign 
exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These forward foreign exchange 
contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in 
earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency assets and liabilities. 
The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that contain credit 
risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative 
counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. As of 
December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, the total amount of cash collateral paid by the Company under the CSA amounted to 
$4.0 billion and $0.8 billion net respectively, related to net investment and cash flow hedges. On an ongoing basis, the 
Company monitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the 
Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. 
Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this footnote for receivables 
and payables with these commercial institutions. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for 
forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $42.9 billion, $39.7 billion 
and $10.0 billion, respectively. As of January 1, 2023, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign 
exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $41.5 billion, $36.2 billion and $10.0 billion, 
respectively. 
All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded 
each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a 
hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction. 
The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all derivatives are 
expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are accounted for under the 
forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in the income statement when the 
hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive 
income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then reclassified to earnings in the same account as the 
hedged transaction. 
Gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to changes in 
interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on net investment hedges 
are accounted through the currency translation account within accumulated other comprehensive income. The portion 
excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the spot method. On an ongoing 
basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If 
and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued. 
The Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to 2035 as a net 
investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional 
currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates. 
As of December 31, 2023, the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
was $377 million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and 
Note 13. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange contracts will be 
reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected to occur over that period. The 
maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is 18 months, excluding interest rate 
contracts and net investment hedges. The amount ultimately realized in earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. 
Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative.

* Includes the 9.5% remaining stake in Kenvue and the $0.4 billion unfavorable change in fair value of the investment between separation date 
and the end of the fiscal year. 
For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023 for equity investments without readily determinable market 
values, $1 million and $51 million, respectively, of the changes in fair value reflected in net income were the result of 
impairments. There were offsetting impacts of $27 million and $142 million, respectively, of changes in the fair value reflected 
in net income due to changes in observable prices and gains on the disposal of investments. 
Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based 
measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. In accordance 
with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are 
described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. 
The fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts) is the 
aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the prevailing market interest rates and 
subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that fair 
values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or 
that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial 
position. The Company also holds equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as 
Level 2. The Company holds acquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, 
which are classified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques 
for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimations. 
The following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value: 
Level 1— Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 
Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs. 
Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.

(2) Translation rate at December 31, 2023. 
(3) Translation rate at January 1, 2023. 
(4) The excess of the carrying value over the fair value of debt was $1.0 billion and $1.6 billion at the end of fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 
2022, respectively. 
Fair value of the long-term debt was estimated using market prices, which were corroborated by quoted broker prices and 
significant other observable inputs. 
The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2023, the Company 
secured a new 364-day Credit Facility of $10 billion, which expires on September 5, 2024. The Company early terminated the 
additional 364-day revolving Credit Facility of $10 billion, which had an expiration of November 21, 2023. Interest charged on 
borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either the Term SOFR Reference Rate or other applicable market 
rates as allowed under the terms of the agreement, plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreements are 
not material. 
Throughout fiscal years 2023 and 2022, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper 
market. Short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt amounted to approximately $3.5 billion and $12.8 
billion at the end of fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The current portion of the long term debt was $1.5 billion and 
$1.6 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively, and the remainder is commercial paper and local borrowing by international 
subsidiaries. 
The current debt balance as of December 31, 2023 includes $2.0 billion of commercial paper which has a weighted average 
interest rate of 5.37% and a weighted average maturity of approximately two months. The current debt balance as of January 
1, 2023 includes $11.2 billion of commercial paper which has a weighted average interest rate of 4.23% and a weighted average 
maturity of approximately two months. 
Aggregate maturities of long-term debt obligations commencing in 2024 are:

A comparison of income tax expense at the U.S. statutory rate of 21% in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, to the Company's 
effective tax rate is as follows: 
(Dollars in Millions) 2023 2022 2021 
U.S. $(2,033) 4,606 4,275 
International 17,095 14,753 14,903 
Earnings before taxes on income: $15,062 19,359 19,178 
Tax rates: 
U.S. statutory rate 21.0% 21.0 21.0 
International operations (1) (8.1) (5.0) (19.1) 
U.S. Tax Settlements (3.0) 
U.S. taxes on international income(2) (0.3) (1.1) 8.9 
Tax benefits from loss on capital assets (1.6) 
Tax benefits on share-based compensation (0.8) (1.4) (1.2) 
All other 2.7 1.9 (0.8) 
Effective Rate 11.5% 15.4 7.2 
(1) International operations reflect the impacts of operations in jurisdictions with statutory tax rates different than the U.S., particularly 
Ireland, Switzerland, Belgium and Puerto Rico, which is a favorable impact on the effective tax rate as compared with the U.S. statutory 
rate. 
(2) 
Includes the impact of the GILTI tax, the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction and other foreign income that is taxable under the 
U.S. tax code. The 2023 and 2022 amount includes the impact of certain provisions of the 2017 TCJA that became effective in fiscal 
2022. The 2023 amount includes the impact of certain foreign subsidiaries deferred tax remeasurements for legislative elections and the 
2021 amounts include the reorganization of international subsidiaries further described below. 
The fiscal year 2023 effective tax rate decreased 3.9% as compared to the fiscal year 2022 effective tax rate as the 
Company recorded certain non-recurring favorable tax items in fiscal year 2023 when compared to the prior fiscal year. 
In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, the Company settled the U.S. Internal Revenue Service audit for tax years 2013 through 
2016 which resulted in a favorable impact to the rate of 3.0%. This settlement was partially offset by the Company recording a 
$0.4 billion decrease in expected U.S. foreign tax credits, an unfavorable effective rate impact of 2.6%, which has been 
reflected as a current tax expense in U.S. taxes on international income on the Company's effective tax rate reconciliation. 
In the fiscal year 2023, the Company had certain non-recurring impacts as a result of legislative tax elections made in certain 
international subsidiaries which resulted in a change in the Company's tax basis in certain assets resulting in deferred tax re-
measurements. The net impact of these non-recurring items is a net benefit of 3.4% to the Company's annual effective tax 
rate, comprised of the following items: 
• approximately $0.3 billion of tax benefit on local deferred tax assets to record the remeasurement of the increased tax 
basis, this benefit has been reflected as International operations on the Company's effective tax rate reconciliation. This 
benefit was offset by approximately $0.1 billion of U.S. deferred tax expense on the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting 
from the remeasurement of these deferred tax assets. This has been reflected in the "U.S. tax on international income" on 
the Company's effective tax rate reconciliation. 
• approximately $0.3 billion of U.S. deferred tax benefit on the GILTI deferred tax as a result of an international subsidiary 
making an election to change the treatment of a local deferred tax asset to a refundable tax credit. This has been reflected 
in the U.S. taxes on international income on the Company's effective tax rate reconciliation. 
The Company's 2023 and 2022 tax rates benefited from certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that became 
effective in fiscal 2022. The Company also had lower income in higher tax jurisdictions vs. fiscal year 2022, primarily in the U.S. 
where the Company recorded an approximately $7.0 billion charge related to talc matters in the United States at an effective 
tax rate of 21.1% (for further information see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
The fiscal year 2022 effective tax rate increased 8.2% as compared to the fiscal year 2021 effective tax rate as the Company 
recorded certain non-recurring favorable tax items in fiscal year 2021 which resulted in an unfavorable impact to the 
Company's fiscal 2022 effective tax rate when compared to the prior fiscal year. These items are described below. The 
Company's 2022 tax rate also benefited from the impairment of bermekimab for AD IPR&D and changes in the fair value of 
securities in the Company's investment portfolio, both recorded at the U.S. statutory rate.

In the fiscal year 2021, the Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain wholly-owned international subsidiaries. As 
part of this reorganization, the Company increased the tax basis of certain assets to fair value in accordance with applicable 
local regulations. The net impact of this restructuring was approximately $0.6 billion net benefit or 3.2% benefit to the 
Company's annual effective tax rate, comprised of the following items: 
• approximately $2.3 billion of local deferred tax assets to record the remeasurement of the tax basis of these assets to fair 
value, this benefit has been reflected as International operations on the Company's effective tax rate reconciliation. 
• approximately $1.7 billion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting from the 
remeasurement of these deferred tax assets. This expense has been reflected as U.S. taxes on international income on the 
Company's effective tax rate reconciliation. 
Also, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, the Company recognized a loss on certain U.S. affiliates related to the previously 
impaired book value of certain intangibles, which reduced the 2021 effective tax rate by approximately 1.6% which is reflected 
as a Tax benefits from loss on capital assets on the effective tax rate reconciliation. Additionally other fiscal 2021 impacts to 
the rate were primarily driven by litigation and acquisition related items as follows: 
• the Company accrued additional legal expenses, of approximately $1.6 billion for talc at an effective tax rate of 23.5% and 
$0.8 billion for Risperdal Gynecomastia settlements at an effective tax rate of 16.4% (See Note 19 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements for more details). 
• the Company recorded a partial IPR&D charge of $0.9 billion for the Ottava intangible asset (acquired with the Auris Health 
acquisition in 2019) at an effective rate of 22.4%. 
Temporary differences and carryforwards at the end of fiscal years 2023 and 2022 were as follows:

(Dollars in Millions) Asset Liability Asset Liability 
Employee related obligations $586 685

Total deferred income taxes $12,670 (6,584) 12,836 (7,880) 
(1) 
(2) In fiscal 2023, the Company changed the presentation of income taxes accrued on intercompany profits on inventory still owned by the 
Company as part of "Prepaid expenses and other" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
Net of valuation allowances of $1.1 billion and $0.8 billion in 2023 and 2022. The change in the valuation allowance from 2022 to 2023 was 
driven by approximately $0.1 billion from acquisition related activity and the remainder was due to normal operations during the fiscal year. 
The Company has wholly-owned international subsidiaries that have cumulative net losses. The Company believes that it is 
more likely than not that these subsidiaries will generate future taxable income sufficient to utilize these deferred tax assets. 
However, in certain jurisdictions, valuation allowances have been recorded against deferred tax assets for loss carryforwards 
that are not more likely than not to be realized. 
The following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized tax benefits for continuing operations:

As of December 31, 2023 the Company had approximately $2.5 billion of unrecognized tax benefits. The Company conducts 
business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress with a number of tax authorities. 
With respect to the United States the Internal Revenue Service has completed its audit for all tax years through 2016. 
In other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audits go back to the 
year 2008. The Company believes it is possible that some tax audits may be completed over the next twelve months by taxing 
authorities in some jurisdictions, including in the United States. However, the Company is not able to provide a reasonably 
reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments or change in uncertain tax positions, if any. 
The Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties as long-term liabilities. 
Interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense. The Company 
recognized after tax interest expense of $99 million, $136 million and $42 million in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, 
respectively. The total amount of accrued interest was $264 million and $637 million in fiscal years 2023 and 
2022, respectively.

10. Pensions and other benefit plans 
The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination 
indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. The Company also provides post-retirement benefits, primarily 
healthcare, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and their dependents. 
Many international employees are covered by government -sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not significant. 
In the U.S, non-union pension benefits for employees hired before January 1, 2015 are primarily based on the employee's 
compensation during the last five years before retirement and the number of years of service (the Final Average Pay formula). 
U.S. pension benefits for employees hired after 2O14, are calculated using a different formula based on employee 
compensation over total years of service (the Retirement Value formula). 
In January 2021, the Company announced that, effective on January 1, 2026, all eligible U.S. non-union employees, regardless 
of hire date, will earn benefits under the Retirement Value formula. This amendment does not affect the benefits accrued 
under the Final Average Pay formula for service before January 1, 2026. 
International subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under group 
contracts, or reserves are provided. 
The Company does not fund retiree healthcare benefits in advance and has the right to modify these plans in the future. 
In 2023 and 2022 the Company used December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, as the measurement date for 
all U.S. and international retirement and other benefit plans. 
Net periodic benefit costs for the Company's defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans for 2023, 2022 and

Curtailments and settlements 93 1 1 (5) 
Net periodic benefit cost (credit) $(676) (62) 607 487 533 502 
The service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is presented in the same line items on the Consolidated Statement of 
Earnings where other employee compensation costs are reported, including Cost of products sold, Research and development 
expense, Selling, marketing and administrative expenses, and Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes if related 
to the separation of Kenvue. All other components of net periodic benefit cost are presented as part of Other (income) 
expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, with the exception of certain amounts for curtailments and 
settlements, which are reported in Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes if related to the separation of 
Kenvue (as noted above). 
Unrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service for each 
plan. For plans with no active employees, they are amortized over the average life expectancy. The amortization of gains and 
losses for the other U.S. benefit plans is determined by using a 10% corridor of the greater of the market value of assets or the 
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Total unamortized gains and losses in excess of the corridor are amortized 
over the average remaining future service. 
Prior service costs/benefits for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service of plan 
participants at the time of the plan amendment. Prior service cost/benefit for the other U.S. benefit plans is amortized over 
the average remaining service to full eligibility age of plan participants at the time of the plan amendment.

The following table represents the weighted -average actuarial assumptions: 
Retirement Plans Other Benefit Plans 
Worldwide Benefit Plans 2023 2022 2021 2023 2022 2021 
Net Periodic Benefit Cost 
Service cost discount rate 4.85% 2.46 2.14 5.40 2.59 2.09 
Interest cost discount rate 5.25% 2.80 2.34 5.43 2.64 2.33 
Rate of increase in compensation levels 3.71% 4.02 4.01 4.22 4.21 4.25 
Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 7.21% 7.25 7.71 
Benefit Obligation 
Discount rate 4.58% 5.01 2.49 5.11 5.42 2.68 
Rate of increase in compensation levels 3.69% 4.00 4.01 4.22 4.21 4.21 
The Company's discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-term fixed 
income instruments. The resulting discount rates are consistent with the duration of plan liabilities. The Company's 
methodology in determining service and interest cost uses duration specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' 
liability cash flows. 
The expected rates of return on plan asset assumptions represent the Company's assessment of long-term returns on 
diversified investment portfolios globally. The assessment is determined using projections from external financial sources, 
long-term historical averages, actual returns by asset class and the various asset class allocations by market. 
The following table displays the assumed healthcare cost trend rates, for all individuals: 
Healthcare Plans 2023 2022 
Healthcare cost trend rate assumed for next year 13.90% " 5.96% 
Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (ultimate trend) 4.00% 3.99% 
Year the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate 2048 2047 
*excludes ongoing negotiations regarding healthcare cost with service providers 
The following table sets forth information related to the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets at fiscal year-end

The Company plans to continue to fund its U.S. Qualified Plans to comply with the Pension Protection Act of 2006. 
International Plans are funded in accordance with local regulations. Additional discretionary contributions are made when 
deemed appropriate to meet the long-term obligations of the plans. For certain plans, funding is not a common practice, as 
funding provides no economic benefit. Consequently, the Company has several pension plans that are not funded. 
In 2023, the Company contributed $135 million and $133 million to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively. 
The following table displays the funded status of the Company's U.S. Qualified & Non-Qualified pension plans and international 
funded and unfunded pension plans at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively:

Plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets have an accumulated benefit obligation, projected benefit 
obligation and plan assets of $5.8 billion, $6.1 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, at the end of 2023, and $2.7 billion, $2.7 
billion and $0.3 billion, respectively, at the end of 2022. 
The following table displays the projected future benefit payments from the Company's retirement and other benefit plans:

The following table displays the projected future minimum contributions to the unfunded retirement plans. These amounts do 
not include any discretionary contributions that the Company may elect to make in the future.

Projected future contributions $122 126 133 139 145 787 
Each pension plan is overseen by a local committee or board that is responsible for the overall administration and investment of 
the pension plans. In determining investment policies, strategies and goals, each committee or board considers factors 
including, local pension rules and regulations; local tax regulations; availability of investment vehicles (separate accounts, 
commingled accounts, insurance funds, etc.); funded status of the plans; ratio of actives to retirees; duration of liabilities; and 
other relevant factors including: diversification, liquidity of local markets and liquidity of base currency. A majority of the 
Company's pension funds are open to new entrants and are expected to be on-going plans. Permitted investments are primarily 
liquid and/or listed, with little reliance on illiquid and non-traditional investments such as hedge funds. 
The Company's retirement plan asset allocation at the end of 2023 and 2022 and target allocations for 2024 are as follows:

Determination of fair value of plan assets 
The Plan has an established and well-documented process for determining fair values. Fair value is based upon quoted market 
prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon models that primarily use, as inputs, 
market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt 
prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. 
While the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of 
different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different 
estimate of fair value at the reporting date. 
Valuation hierarchy 
The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels 
within the hierarchy are described in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. 
The Net Asset Value (NAV) is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then 
divided by the number of shares outstanding. 
A financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant 
to the fair value measurement. 
Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value. 
• Short-term investment funds — Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the amount held 
on deposit by the custodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the NAV provided by the 
administrator of the fund. The NAV is a quoted price in a market that is not active and classified as Level 2. 
• Government and agency securities — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the 
major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the 
investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific 
security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or 
discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not available in an active market, they are classified as 
Level 2. 
• Debt instruments — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on 
which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are 
classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by 
using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and are classified as 
Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable inputs. 
• Equity securities - Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual 
securities are traded. Substantially all equity securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. 
• Commingled funds — These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Assets in the 
Level 2 category have a quoted market price. 
• Other assets — Other assets are represented primarily by limited partnerships. These investment vehicles are valued using 
the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Other assets that are exchange listed and actively traded are classified as 
Level 1, while inactively traded assets are classified as Level 2.

Amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income are presented net of the related tax impact. Foreign currency 
translation is not adjusted for income taxes where it relates to permanent investments in international subsidiaries. For 
additional details on comprehensive income see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 
Details on reclassifications out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income: 
Gain/(Loss) On Securities - reclassifications released to Other (income) expense, net. 
Employee Benefit Plans - reclassifications are included in net periodic benefit cost. See Note 10 for additional details. 
Gain/(Loss) On Derivatives & Hedges - reclassifications to earnings are recorded in the same account as the hedged 
transaction. See Note 6 for additional details. 
* Includes impact of curtailments and settlements in connection with separation from Kenvue. 
14. International currency translation 
For translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. Dollar currencies, the Company has determined that the local currencies 
of its international subsidiaries are the functional currencies except those in highly inflationary economies, which are defined as 
those which have had compound cumulative rates of inflation of 100% or more during the past three years, or where a 
substantial portion of its cash flows are not in the local currency. For the majority of the Company's subsidiaries the local 
currency is the functional currency. 
In consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency effects are recorded as a component of accumulated other 
comprehensive income. The other current and non-current assets line within the Statement of Cash flows includes the impact 
of foreign currency translation. This equity account includes the results of translating certain balance sheet assets and 
liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical rates, except for those located in highly inflationary 
economies (Argentina and Venezuela). Beginning in the fiscal second quarter of 2022, the Company also accounted for 
operations in Turkey as highly inflationary. The translation of balance sheet accounts for highly inflationary economies are 
reflected in the operating results. 
A rollforward of the changes during fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 for foreign currency translation adjustments is included 
in Note 13. 
Net currency transaction gains and losses included in Other (income) expense were losses of $366 million, $286 million and 
$216 million in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

15. Earnings per share 
The following is a reconciliation of basic net earnings per share to diluted net earnings per share for the fiscal years ended 
December 31, 2023, January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022: 
(In Millions Except Per Share Amounts) 2023 2022 2021 
Basic net earnings per share from continuing operations $5.26 6.23 6.76 
Basic net earnings per share from discontinued operations 8.62 0.60 1.17 
Total net earnings per share - basic 13.88 6.83 7.93 
Average shares outstanding — basic 2,533.5 2,625.2 2,632.1 
Potential shares exercisable under stock option plans 94.1 140.1 138.0 
Less: shares repurchased under treasury stock method (67.2) (101.4) (96.1) 
Adjusted average shares outstanding — diluted 2,560.4 2,663.9 2,674.0 
Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations 5.20 6.14 6.66 
Diluted net earnings per share from discontinuing operations 8.52 0.59 1.15 
Total net earnings per share - diluted $13.72 6.73 7.81 
The diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2023 excluded 43 million shares related to stock options, as the 
exercise price of these options was greater than the average market value of the Company's stock. 
The diluted net earnings per share calculation for the fiscal years 2022 and 2021 included all shares related to stock options, 
as the exercise price of these options was less than the average market value of the Company's stock. 
16. Common stock, stock option plans and stock compensation agreements 
At December 31, 2023, the Company had one stock-based compensation plan. The shares outstanding are for contracts under 
the Company's 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan 
expired on April 26, 2022. All awards (stock options, restricted shares units and performance share units) granted subsequent 
to that date were under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company may 
issue up to 150 million shares of common stock, of which up to 110 million shares of common stock may be issued subject to 
stock options or stock appreciation rights and up to 40 million shares of common stock may be issued subject to full value 
awards. Awards will generally be counted on a 1-for-1 basis against the share reserve, provided that if more than 40 million full 
value awards are granted, each full value award in excess of 40 million will be counted on a 5-for-1 basis against the share 
reserve. Shares available for future grants under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan were 130 million at the end of 
fiscal year 2023. 
The compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $1,087 million, $1,028 million and $1,038 
million for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for 
share-based compensation costs was $221 million, $177 million and $199 million for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, 
respectively. The Company also recognized additional income tax benefits of $126 million, $267 million and $213 million for 
fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for which options were exercised or restricted shares were vested. The total 
unrecognized compensation cost was $907 million, $866 million and $775 million for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, 
respectively. The weighted average period for this cost to be recognized was 1.80 years, 1.80 years and 1.78 years for fiscal 
years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Share-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were insignificant 
in all periods. 
The Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished through market 
purchases throughout the year for the number of shares used to settle employee benefit equity issuances.

Stock options 
Stock options expire 10 years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 4 years. 
Options granted under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan were granted at the average of the high and low prices of the 
Company's Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. Options granted under the 2022 Long-Term 
incentive Plan were granted at the closing price of the Company's Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the 
date of grant. 
The fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model that 
uses the assumptions noted in the following table. For 2023, 2022, and 2021 grants, expected volatility represents a blended 
rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied volatility rate based on at-the-money 
traded Johnson & Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For all grants, historical data is used to determine the expected life of 
the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. 
The average fair value of options granted was $27.85, $23.23 and $20.86, in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
The fair value was estimated based on the weighted average assumptions of: 
2023 2022 2021 
Risk-free rate 3.74% 1.98% 0.83% 
Expected volatility 17.69% 18.00% 18.59% 
Expected life (in years) 7.0 7.0 7.0 
Expected dividend yield 2.90% 2.70% 2.50%

Restricted share units and performance share units 
The Company grants restricted share units which vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years. The Company 
also grants performance share units, which are paid in shares of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock after the end of a 
three-year performance period. Performance shares were granted with two equally-weighted goals that directly align with or 
help drive long-term total shareholder return: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. The 
number of shares actually earned at the end of the three-year period will vary, based only on actual performance, from 0% to 
200% of the target number of performance share units granted. 
A summary of the restricted share units and performance share units activity under the Plans as of December 31, 2023 is 
presented below:

Shares at December 31, 2023 12,938 2,037 
*includes 1,421 shares of restricted share units and 264 shares of performance share units cancelled as a result of the conversion of Johnson & 
Johnson restricted share units and performance share units held by Kenvue employees into Kenvue restricted share units 
The average fair value of the restricted share units granted was $152.63, $153.67 and $152.62 in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 
2021, respectively, using the fair market value at the date of grant. The fair value of restricted share units was discounted for 
dividends, which are not paid on the restricted share units during the vesting period. The fair value of restricted share units 
issued was $605 million, $591 million and $611 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
The weighted average fair value of the performance share units granted was $145.17, $170.46 and $179.35 in fiscal years 
2023, 2022 and 2021, calculated using the weighted average fair market value for each of the component goals at the date 
of grant. 
The fair values for the earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the 
fair market value of the shares at the time of the award discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share 
units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was 
estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. The fair value of performance share units issued was 
$140 million, $94 million and $83 million in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

(6) • Litigation expense of $0.1 billion 
Long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, net for fiscal years 2023, and 2022 of $19,898 and $17,982, respectively, and 
intangible assets and goodwill, net for fiscal years 2023 and 2022 of $70,733 and $74,536, respectively. 
18. Acquisitions and divestitures 
In the fiscal first quarter of 2O24, the Company announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Ambrx 
Biopharma, Inc., or Ambrx (Nasdaq: AMAM), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a proprietary synthetic biology 
technology platform to design and develop next-generation antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), in an all-cash merger transaction 
for a total equity value of approximately $2.0 billion, or $1.9 billion net of estimated cash acquired. The Company will acquire 
all of the outstanding shares of Ambrx's common stock for $28.00 per share through a merger of Ambrx with a subsidiary of 
the Company. The closing of the transaction is expected to occur in the first half of 2O24, subject to receipt of Ambrx 
shareholder approval, as well as clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary 
closing conditions. The Company expects that the transaction will be accounted for as a business combination and the results 
of operations will be included in the Innovative Medicine segment as of the acquisition date. 
During the fiscal year 2023, the Company did not make any acquisitions that qualified as a business combination. 
During the fiscal year 2023, there were asset acquisitions of in-process research and development of approximately 
$0.5 billion in cash, primarily consisting of the acquisition of Laminar Inc. for $0.4 billion which was closed on November 30, 
2023. Laminar Inc. is a privately-held medical device company focused on eliminating the left atrial appendage (LAA) in 
patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AFib). 
During the fiscal year 2022, certain businesses were acquired for $17.7 billion in cash and $1.1 billion of liabilities assumed. 
These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included 
in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. 
The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $17.3 billion and has been 
assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. 
The fiscal year 2022 acquisitions primarily included Abiomed, Inc. (Abiomed). The remaining acquisitions were not material. 
On December 22, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Abiomed, a leading, first-to-market provider of 
cardiovascular medical technology with a first-in-kind portfolio for the treatment of coronary artery disease and heart failure 
which also has an extensive innovation pipeline of life-saving technologies. The transaction broadens the Company's position as 
a growing cardiovascular innovator, advancing the standard of care in heart failure and recovery, one of healthcare's largest 
areas of unmet need. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and the results of operations were included 
in the MedTech segment as of the date of the acquisition. The acquisition was completed through a tender offer for all 
outstanding shares. The consideration paid in the acquisition consisted of an upfront payment of $380.00 per share in cash, 
amounting to $17.1 billion, net of cash acquired, as well as a non-tradeable contingent value right ("CVR") entitling the holder to 
receive up to $35.00 per share in cash (which with respect to the CVRs total approximately $1.6 billion in the aggregate) if 
certain commercial and clinical milestones are achieved. The corresponding enterprise value (without taking into account the 
CVRs) of approximately $16.5 billion includes cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities acquired. 
The milestones of the CVR consist of: 
a. $17.50 per share, payable if net sales for Abiomed products exceeds $3.7 billion during Johnson & Johnson's fiscal second 
quarter of 2O27 through fiscal first quarter of 2028, or if this threshold is not met during this period and is subsequently 
met during any rolling four quarter period up to the end of Johnson & Johnson's fiscal first quarter of 2029, $8.75 
per share; 
b. $7.50 per share payable upon FDA premarket application approval of the use of Impella® products in ST-elevated 
myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients without cardiogenic shock by January 1, 2028; and 
c. $10.00 per share payable upon the first publication of a Class I recommendation for the use of Impella® products in high 
risk PCI or STEMI with or without cardiogenic shock within four years from their respective clinical endpoint publication 
dates, but in all cases no later than December 31, 2029. 
During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation. In the fiscal 2023, there were 
purchase price allocation adjustments netting to approximately $0.2 billion with an offsetting increase to goodwill. The fair 
value of the acquisition was allocated to assets acquired of $20.1 billion (net of $0.3 billion cash acquired), primarily to goodwill 
for $11.1 billion, amortizable intangible assets for $6.6 billion, IPR&D for $1.1 billion, marketable securities of $0.6 billion and

liabilities assumed of $3.0 billion, which includes the fair value of the contingent consideration mentioned above for $0.7 billion 
and deferred taxes of $2.0 billion. The goodwill is primarily attributable to the commercial acceleration and expansion of the 
portfolio and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The contingent consideration was recorded in Other Liabilities 
and adjusted to fair value through the fiscal year end 2023 on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
The amortizable intangible assets were primarily comprised of already in-market products of the Impella® platform with an 
average weighted life of 14 years. The IPR&D assets were valued for technology programs for unapproved products. The value 
of the IPR&D was calculated using probability -adjusted cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. 
The probability of success factor ranged from 52% to 70%. The discount rate applied was 9.5%. 
In 2023, the Company recorded acquisition related costs before tax of approximately $0.2 billion, which was primarily 
recorded in Other (income)/expense. In 2022, the Company recorded acquisition related costs before tax of approximately 
$0.3 billion, which was recorded in Other (income)/expense. 
During fiscal year 2021, the Company did not make any material acquisitions that qualified as a business combination. 
In accordance with U.S. GAAP standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible assets, 
supplemental pro forma information for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 is not provided, as the impact of the aforementioned 
acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations. 
Divestitures 
During the fiscal year 2023, the Company executed divestitures resulting in approximately $0.2 billion in proceeds resulting in 
gains or losses that were not material. At fiscal year end 2023, the Company held assets, primarily intangibles, on its 
Consolidated Balance Sheet that it expects to divest of approximately $0.3 billion primarily related to Acclarent and Ponvory. 
During fiscal year 2022, the Company did not make any material divestitures. 
During fiscal year 2021, in separate transactions, the Company divested two brands outside the U.S. within the Innovative 
Medicine segment. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net, of 
approximately $0.6 billion. 
19. Legal proceedings 
Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability; 
intellectual property; commercial; indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings 
that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business. 
The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability 
will be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has 
determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The 
Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be 
warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25, Contingencies. For these 
and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is 
unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies 
often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and 
assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by 
various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or 
indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters 
present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and 
unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of 
related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse awards, judgments 
or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be 
probable and can be reasonably estimated. 
In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the 
ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a 
material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more 
of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash 
flows for that period.

Matters concerning talc 
A significant number of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer have been asserted against Johnson & Johnson 
Consumer Inc., its successor LTL Management LLC (now known as LLT Management LLC) and the Company arising out of the 
use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON'S Baby Powder. 
In talc cases that previously have gone to trial, the Company has obtained a number of defense verdicts, but there also have 
been verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020, the Missouri Court of Appeals 
reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $4.7 billion in Ingham v. Johnson & Johnson, et al., No. ED 207476 
(Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $2.1 billion. An application for transfer of the case to the Missouri Supreme Court was 
subsequently denied and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari, seeking a review of the Ingham decision by the United States 
Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company paid the award, which, including interest, totaled approximately 
$2.5 billion. The facts and circumstances, including the terms of the award, were unique to the Ingham decision and not 
representative of other claims brought against the Company. The Company continues to believe that it has strong legal 
grounds to contest the other talc verdicts that it has appealed. Notwithstanding the Company's confidence in the safety of its 
talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has settled cases. 
In October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring (the 2021 Corporate 
Restructuring). As a result of that restructuring, Old JJCI ceased to exist and three new entities were created: (a) LTL 
Management LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A&M LLC, a North Carolina limited 
liability company and a direct subsidiary of LTL (RAM); and (c) the Debtor's direct parent, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., a 
New Jersey company (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI's assets and became solely responsible for the talc-
related liabilities of Old JJCI, including all liabilities related in any way to injury or damage, or alleged injury or damage, sustained 
or incurred in the purchase or use of, or exposure to, talc, including talc contained in any product, or to the risk of, or 
responsibility for, any such damage or injury, except for any liabilities for which the exclusive remedy is provided under a 
workers' compensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities). 
In October 2021, notwithstanding the Company's confidence in the safety of its talc products, the Debtor filed a voluntary 
petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte Division, seeking relief 
under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL Bankruptcy Case). All litigation against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the 
Company, other of their corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties (the Protected 
Parties) was stayed, although LTL did agree to lift the stay on a small number of appeals where appeal bonds had been filed. 
The LTL Bankruptcy Case was transferred to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. Claimants 
filed motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and, following a multiple day hearing, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court 
denied those motions in March 2022. 
The claimants subsequently filed notices of appeal as to the denial of the motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and the 
extension of the stay to the Protected Parties. On January 30, 2023, the Third Circuit reversed the Bankruptcy Court's ruling 
and remanded to the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy. 
LTL filed a petition for rehearing of the Third Circuit's decision, which was denied in March 2023. LTL subsequently filed a 
motion in the Third Circuit to stay the mandate directing the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy 
pending filing and disposition of a petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. The Third Circuit denied 
the motion to stay the mandate and issued the mandate. 
In April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court dismissed the LTL Bankruptcy Case, effectively lifting the stay as to all 
parties and returning the talc litigation to the tort system. LTL re-filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District 
of New Jersey seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL 2 Bankruptcy Case). As a result of the new 
filing, all talc claims against LTL were again automatically stayed pursuant to section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code. 
Additionally, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court issued a temporary restraining order staying all litigation as to LTL, Old JJCI, 
New JJCI, the Company, identified retailers, and certain other parties (the New Protected Parties). 
Also in April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court issued a decision that granted limited injunctive relief to the Company 
and the New Protected Parties (the LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction). The LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction remained in force until late 
August 2023, following the Bankruptcy Court's extension of the initial LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction in June 2023. Under the 
LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction, except for in those cases filed in the federal court ovarian cancer multi-district litigation, 
discovery in all personal injury and wrongful death matters was permitted to proceed. 
Furthermore, in April 2023, the Talc Claimants' Committee filed a motion to dismiss the LTL 2 Bankruptcy followed by similar 
motions from other claimants. Hearings on the motions to dismiss occurred in June 2023. On July 28, 2023, the court 
dismissed the LTL 2 Bankruptcy case and, the same day, the Company stated its intent to appeal the decision and to continue 
its efforts to obtain a resolution of the talc claims. In September 2023, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order granting LTL 
leave to seek a direct appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. In October 2023, the Third Circuit granted LTL's petition 
for a direct appeal. Briefing is ongoing.

Following the dismissal of LTL 2, new lawsuits were filed and cases across the country that had been stayed were reactivated. 
The majority of the cases are pending in federal court, organized in a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District 
Court for the District of New Jersey. In the MDL, case-specific discovery is proceeding with an expectation that a trial will 
occur in early 2025. Separately, discovery and pre-trial activity is underway in various individually filed and set cases around 
the country, with most activity for such cases centralized in New Jersey and California. 
In the original bankruptcy case, the Company agreed to provide funding to LTL for the payment of amounts the New Jersey 
Bankruptcy Court determines are owed by LTL and the establishment of a $2 billion trust in furtherance of this purpose. The 
Company established a reserve for approximately $2 billion in connection with the aforementioned trust. During the 
bankruptcy proceedings LTL had been de-consolidated by the Company. In the LTL 2 Bankruptcy Case, the Company had 
agreed to contribute an additional amount which, when added to the prior $2 billion, would be a total reserve of approximately 
$9 billion payable over 25 years (nominal value approximately $12 billion discounted at a rate of 4.41%), to resolve all the 
current and future talc claims. The approximate $9 billion reserve encompasses actual and contemplated settlements, of which 
approximately one-third is recorded as a current liability. The recorded amount remains the Company's best estimate of 
probable loss after the dismissal. 
The parties have not yet reached a resolution of all talc matters and the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or 
range of loss beyond the amount accrued. 
A class action advancing claims relating to industrial talc was filed against the Company and others in New Jersey state court 
in May 2022 (the Edley Class Action). The Edley Class Action asserts, among other things, that the Company fraudulently 
defended past asbestos personal injury lawsuits arising from exposure to industrial talc mined, milled, and manufactured before 
January 6,1989 by the Company's then wholly owned subsidiary, Windsor Minerals, Inc., which is currently a debtor in the 
Imerys Bankruptcy described hereafter. The Company removed the Edley Class Action to federal court in the District of New 
Jersey. In October 2022, the Company filed motions to dismiss and to deny certification of a class to pursue the Edley Class 
Action in the New Jersey District Court. Argument on the motions was heard in November 2023. Thereafter, the Company 
resolved this matter. 
In February 2019, the Company's talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc Vermont, Inc. and 
Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the United States Code 
(the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys 
Bankruptcy relates to Imerys's potential liability for personal injury from exposure to talcum powder sold by Imerys. In its 
bankruptcy, Imerys alleges it has claims against the Company for indemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds. In its 
bankruptcy, Imerys proposed a chapter 11 plan (the Imerys Plan) that contemplated all talc-related claims against it being 
channeled to a trust along with its alleged indemnification rights against the Company. Following confirmation and 
consummation of the plan, the trust would pay talc claims pursuant to proposed trust distribution procedures (the TDP) and 
then seek indemnification from the Company. 
In February 2021, Cyprus Mines Corporation (Cyprus), which had owned certain Imerys talc mines, filed a voluntary petition for 
relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and filed its Disclosure Statement and Plan (the Cyprus Plan). The Cyprus Plan 
contemplates a settlement with Imerys and talc claimants where Cyprus would make a monetary contribution to a trust 
established under the Imerys Plan in exchange for an injunction against talc claims asserted against it and certain 
affiliated parties. 
The Imerys Plan proceeded to solicitation in early 2021. However, the Imerys Plan did not receive the requisite number of 
votes to be confirmed after the Bankruptcy Court ruled certain votes cast in favor of the Imerys Plan should be disregarded. 
Imerys subsequently canceled its confirmation hearing. 
Imerys, the Imerys Tort Claimants' Committee, and the Imerys Future Claimants' Representative, along with Cyprus, the Cyprus 
Tort Claimants' Committee, and the Cyprus Future Claimants' Representative (collectively the Mediation Parties) have been 
engaged in mediation since shortly after the confirmation hearing was canceled in October 2021. In September 2023, the 
Bankruptcy Court entered an order extending the term of the mediation among the Mediation Parties through the end of 
December 2023. The Bankruptcy Court also authorized Imerys and Cyprus to proceed with mediation with certain of their 
insurers through the end of December 2023. 
In September 2023, Imerys and Cyprus filed amended plans of reorganization. The amended plans contemplate a similar 
construct as the prior Imerys and Cyprus Plans, including all talc claims against Imerys and Cyprus (and certain other protected 
parties) being channeled to a trust along with Imerys's and Cyprus's alleged indemnification rights against the Company. In 
January 2024, Imerys and Cyprus filed revised TDP. In February 2024, Imerys and Cyprus filed certain motions related to their 
Disclosure Statement. 
In February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against the Company and certain named officers in the United 
States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the Company violated the federal securities laws by failing to 
disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON'S Baby Powder, and that 
purchasers of the Company's shares suffered losses as a result. In April 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint. In

December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. In April 2021, briefing on Plaintiff's motion for class 
certification was completed. The case was stayed in May 2022 pursuant to the LTL Bankruptcy Case and was reopened in May 
2023. In December 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff's motion for class certification. In January 2024, Defendants filed a 
petition with the Third Circuit under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f) for permission to appeal the Court's order granting 
class certification. Fact discovery is proceeding. 
A lawsuit was brought against the Company in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Diego alleging violations 
of California's Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) relating to JOHNSON'S Baby Powder. In that lawsuit, the plaintiffs allege 
that the Company violated the CLRA by failing to provide required Proposition 65 warnings. In July 2019, the Company filed a 
notice of removal to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California and plaintiffs filed a second 
amended complaint shortly thereafter. In October 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the second amended complaint for 
failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In response to those motions, plaintiffs filed a third amended 
complaint. In December 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the third amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon 
which relief may be granted. In April 2020, the Court granted the motion to dismiss but granted leave to amend. In May 2020, 
plaintiffs filed a Fourth Amended Complaint but indicated that they would be filing a motion for leave to file a fifth amended 
complaint. Plaintiffs filed a Fifth Amended Complaint in August 2020. The Company moved to dismiss the Fifth Amended 
Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In January 2021, the Court issued an Order and opinion 
ruling in the Company's favor and granting the motion to dismiss with prejudice. In February 2021, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of 
Appeal with the Ninth Circuit. Plaintiffs filed their opening brief in July 2021. The company filed its responsive brief in October 
2021. After the Notice of Suggestion of Bankruptcy was filed with the Ninth Circuit, a stay was imposed, and the Court held 
the reply deadline in abeyance. In September 2023, the stay lifted. With briefing complete, the Court is expected to either 
schedule oral argument or issue its decision at any time. 
In June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint in Chancery Court of The First Judicial District of Hinds 
County, Mississippi against the Company and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. (now known as Johnson & 
Johnson Consumer Inc.) (collectively, JJCI). The complaint alleges that JJCI violated the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act 
by failing to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers' use of talc contained in JOHNSON'S Baby Powder 
and JOHNSON'S Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012) and seeks injunctive and monetary relief. In February 2022, 
the trial court set the case for trial to begin in February 2023. However, in October 2022, the LTL bankruptcy court issued an 
order staying the case. In March 2023, the Third Circuit issued the mandate to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and in April 
2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court dismissed the LTL Bankruptcy Case, effectively lifting the stay as to this matter. The 
State requested a new trial setting. Later in April 2023, the trial court set a new trial date for April 2024. The Company filed 
summary judgment and Daubert motions. The State filed a limited Daubert motion. The parties agreed to the Court's request 
for mediation. A pretrial conference is set for February 2024 and trial is scheduled for April 2024. However, the Company is 
actively engaged in resolution discussions concerning this matter. 
In January 2020, the State of New Mexico filed a consumer protection case alleging that the Company deceptively marketed 
and sold its talcum powder products by making misrepresentations about the safety of the products and the presence of 
carcinogens, including asbestos. In March 2022, the New Mexico court denied the Company's motion to compel the State of 
New Mexico to engage in discovery of state agencies and denied the Company's request for interlocutory appeal of that 
decision. The Company then filed a Petition for Writ of Superintending Control and a Request for a Stay to the New Mexico 
Supreme Court on the issue of the State of New Mexico's discovery obligations. In April 2022, in view of the efforts to resolve 
talc-related claims in the LTL Bankruptcy Case, the Company and the State agreed to a 60-day stay of all matters except for 
the pending writ before the New Mexico Supreme Court, which expired in June 2022. Thereafter, the Company moved to 
enjoin prosecution of the case in the LTL Bankruptcy Case. In October 2022, the bankruptcy court issued an order staying the 
case. In December 2022, the State filed an appeal to the Third Circuit concerning the stay order. Separately, in September 
2022, the New Mexico Supreme Court granted the Company's request for a stay pending further briefing on the scope of the 
State of New Mexico's discovery obligations. In March 2023, the Third Circuit issued the mandate to dismiss the LTL 
Bankruptcy Case and in April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court dismissed the LTL Bankruptcy Case, effectively lifting 
the stay as to this matter. While the State notified the New Mexico Supreme Court of the lifted stay of litigation in April 2023, 
the Court has not taken any action since being notified of the lifting of the stay and it remains in effect. 
Forty-two states and the District of Columbia (including Mississippi and New Mexico) have commenced a joint investigation 
into the Company's marketing of its talcum powder products. At this time, the multi-state group has not asserted any claims 
against the Company. Five states have issued Civil Investigative Demands seeking documents and other information. The 
Company has produced documents to Arizona, North Carolina, Texas, and Washington and entered into confidentiality 
agreements. The Company has not received any follow up requests from those states. In March 2022, each of the forty-two 
states agreed to mediation of their claims in the LTL Bankruptcy Case. In July 2022, New Mexico and Mississippi indicated 
they would no longer voluntarily submit to further mediation in the LTL Bankruptcy and would proceed with their respective 
cases in state court. In March 2023, the mediation was terminated. In January 2024, the Company reached an agreement in 
principle with the multi-state group of state Attorneys General, subject to ongoing negotiation of non-monetary terms. The 
unique procedural history and status of the New Mexico and Mississippi matters specifically have been discussed above.

In addition, the Company has received inquiries, subpoenas, and requests to produce documents regarding talc matters and the 
LTL Bankruptcy Case from various governmental authorities. The Company has produced documents and responded to 
inquiries, and will continue to cooperate with government inquiries. 
Matters concerning opioids 
Beginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, the Company and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with other 
pharmaceutical companies, have been named in close to 3,500 lawsuits related to the marketing of opioids, including 
DURAGESIC, NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER. The majority of the cases have been filed by state and local governments. Similar 
lawsuits have also been filed by private plaintiffs and organizations, including but not limited to the following: individual 
plaintiffs on behalf of children born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS); hospitals; and health insurers/payors. 
To date, the Company and JPI have litigated two of the cases to judgment and have prevailed in both, either at trial or 
on appeal. 
In October 2019, the Company announced a proposed agreement in principle with a negotiating committee of state Attorneys 
General to settle all remaining government opioid litigation claims nationwide. Under the final national settlement agreement, 
which was announced in July 2021, the Company agreed to pay up to $5.0 billion to resolve all opioid lawsuits and future opioid 
claims by states, cities, counties, local school districts and other special districts, and tribal governments, contingent on 
sufficient participation by eligible government entities, and with credits back for entities that declined or were ineligible to 
participate. In July 2021, the Company announced that the terms of the agreement to settle the state and subdivision claims 
had been finalized and approximately 60% of the all-in settlement was paid by the end of fiscal 2023. The expected payment 
schedule provides that approximately $0.7 billion of payments are to be paid by the end of fiscal 2024. The agreement is not 
an admission of liability or wrongdoing, and it provides for the release of all opioid-related claims against the Company, JPI, and 
their affiliates (including the Company's former subsidiaries Tasmanian Alkaloids Pty, Ltd. and Noramco, Inc.). As of January 
2024, the Company and JPI have settled or otherwise resolved the opioid claims advanced by all government entity claimants 
except the City of Baltimore, a number of school districts and other claimants. 
The Company and JPI continue to defend the cases brought by the remaining government entity litigants as well as the cases 
brought by private litigants, including NAS claimants, hospitals, and health insurers/payors. Counting the private litigant cases, 
there are approximately 35 remaining opioid cases against the Company and JPI in various state courts, 430 remaining cases 
in the Ohio MDL, and 4 additional cases in other federal courts. Some of these cases have been dismissed and are being 
appealed by the plaintiffs and certain others are scheduled for trial in 2024 or 2025. 
In addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit against the Company and its Canadian affiliate Janssen Inc., and many 
other industry members, in Canada, and is seeking to have that action certified as an opt in class action on behalf of other 
provincial/territorial and the federal governments in Canada. Additional proposed class actions have been filed in Canada 
against the Company and Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, by and on behalf of people who used opioids (for 
personal injuries), municipalities and First Nations bands. These actions allege a variety of claims related to opioid marketing 
practices, including false advertising, unfair competition, public nuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts and 
practices, false claims and unjust enrichment. An adverse judgment in any of these lawsuits could result in the imposition of 
large monetary penalties and significant damages including, punitive damages, cost of abatement, substantial fines, equitable 
remedies and other sanctions. 
From June 2017 through December 2019, the Company's Board of Directors received a series of shareholder demand letters 
alleging breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids. The Board retained independent counsel to 
investigate the allegations in the demands, and in April 2020, independent counsel delivered a report to the Board 
recommending that the Company reject the shareholder demands and take the steps that are necessary or appropriate to 
secure dismissal of related derivative litigation. The Board unanimously adopted the recommendations of the independent 
counsel's report. 
In November 2019, one of the shareholders who sent a demand filed a derivative complaint against the Company as the nominal 
defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court of New Jersey. The 
complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids, and that the Company has suffered 
damages as a result of those alleged breaches. A series of additional derivative complaints making similar allegations against 
the same and similar defendants were filed in New Jersey state and federal courts in 2019 and 2020. By 2022, all but two 
state court cases had been voluntarily dismissed. In February 2022, the state court granted the Company's motion to dismiss 
one of the two cases, and the shareholder that brought the second case filed a notice of dismissal. The shareholder whose 
complaint was dismissed filed a motion for reconsideration. In May 2022, the state court held oral argument on the motion for 
reconsideration and subsequently denied the motion. The shareholder has appealed the state court's dismissal order.

Product liability 
The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits involving multiple 
products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages. While the Company 
believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. From time to time, even if it 
has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements based on a variety of circumstances. The Company has 
accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted 
based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25, Contingencies. The Company 
accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be 
reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs 
associated with settlements, damages and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for 
thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to 
the accruals may be required in the future as additional information becomes available. 
The table below contains the most significant of these cases and provides the approximate number of plaintiffs in the United 
States with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly due to the relevant product or product category as of 
December 31, 2023: 
Product or product category Number of plaintiffs 
Body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON'S Baby Powder 59,140 
DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System 160 
PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System 920 
Pelvic meshes 6,720 
ETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh 370 
RISPERDAL 200 
ELMIRON 2,150 
The number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are 
filed. There may be additional claims that have not yet been filed.

DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and ASR Hip Resurfacing System 
In August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR XL Acetabular System 
and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System (ASR Hip) used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury have been made 
against DePuy and the Company. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district 
litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Litigation has also been filed in countries outside 
of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Germany, India and Italy. In November 2013, 
DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers representing ASR Hip plaintiffs to establish a 
program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip patients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known 
as revision surgery, as of August 2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further 
extended the settlement program to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 2013 and prior to 
February 15, 2017. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000 claims, thereby bringing to resolution significant 
ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program 
does not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that resolved the 
claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. In Canada, the Company has reached agreements to settle the class 
actions filed in that country. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential additional costs 
associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the costs associated with the 
United States settlement program and ASR Hip-related product liability litigation. 
DePuy PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System 
Claims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and the Company (collectively, DePuy) 
relating to the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product liability lawsuits continue to be 
filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. 
Most cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States

District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Texas MDL). Beginning on June 1, 2022, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict 
Litigation ceased transfer of new cases into the Texas MDL, and there are now cases pending in federal court outside the 
Texas MDL. Litigation also has been filed in state courts and in countries outside of the United States. During the first quarter 
of 2019, DePuy established a United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the settlement program, 
adverse verdicts have been settled. The Company has established an accrual for product liability litigation associated with the 
PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System and the related settlement program. 
Ethicon Pelvic Mesh 
Claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company arising out of Ethicon's pelvic mesh 
devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to receive information 
with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States had been organized as a 
multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. In March 2021, the 
MDL Court entered an order closing the MDL. The MDL Court has remanded cases for trial to the jurisdictions where the case 
was originally filed and additional pelvic mesh lawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has 
settled or otherwise resolved the majority of the United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these 
settlements and the remaining cases are reflected in the Company's accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal 
injury cases or claims seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices have been commenced in 
various countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, 
France, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Slovenia and class actions in Israel, Australia, Canada and South Africa. In November 2019, the 
Federal Court of Australia issued a judgment regarding its findings with respect to liability in relation to the three Lead 
Applicants and generally in relation to the design, manufacture, pre and post-market assessments and testing, and supply and 
promotion of the devices in Australia used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. In September 2022, 
after exhausting its appeals, the Company reached an in-principle agreement to resolve the two pelvic mesh class actions in 
Australia and in March 2023 the Federal Court approved the settlement. The class actions in Canada were discontinued in 
2020 as a result of a settlement of a group of cases and an agreement to resolve the Israeli class action was reached in May 
2021. The parties in the Israeli class action are currently finalizing the terms of the settlement. A motion to approve the 
settlement was filed with the Court. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation 
associated with Ethicon's pelvic mesh products. 
Ethicon Physiomesh 
Following a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of Ethicon Physiomesh Flexible Composite Mesh (Physiomesh), claims for 
personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company alleging personal injury arising out of the use of 
this hernia mesh device. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation 
(MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL) also has been 
formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic County for cases pending in New Jersey. In addition to the matters 
in the MDL and MCL, there are additional lawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, 
which are part of the MDL for polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits pending in two New 
Jersey MCLs formed for Proceed/Proceed Ventral Patch and Prolene Hernia systems, and lawsuits pending outside the United 
States. In May 2021, Ethicon and lead counsel for the plaintiffs entered into a term sheet to resolve approximately 3,600 
Physiomesh cases (covering approximately 4,300 plaintiffs) pending in the MDL and MCL at that time. A master settlement 
agreement (MSA) was entered into in September 2021 and includes 3,729 cases in the MDL and MCL. All deadlines and trial 
settings in those proceedings are currently stayed pending the completion of the settlement agreement. Of the cases subject 
to the MSA, 3,390 have been dismissed with prejudice. Ethicon has received releases from 3,584 plaintiffs, and releases 
continue to be submitted as part of the settlement process. Post-settlement cases in the Physiomesh MDL and MCL are 
subject to docket control orders requiring early expert reports and discovery requirements. In May 2023, Ethicon entered an 
additional settlement to resolve the claims of 292 Physiomesh claimants. That settlement is proceeding, and releases are being 
returned. As of December 31, 2023, there were 5 Physiomesh cases in the MDL and 3 in the New Jersey MCL which are not 
included in either settlement and which remain subject to the docket control orders. 
Claims have also been filed against Ethicon and the Company alleging personal injuries arising from the PROCEED Mesh and 
PROCEED Ventral Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an order consolidating 
these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court. Additional cases have been filed in various 
federal and state courts in the United States, and in jurisdictions outside the United States. 
Ethicon and the Company also have been subject to claims for personal injuries arising from the PROLENE Polypropylene 
Hernia System. In January 2020, the New Jersey Supreme Court created an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court to handle 
such cases. Cases involving this product have also been filed in other federal and state courts in the United States. 
In October 2022, an agreement in principle, subject to various conditions, was reached to settle the majority of the pending 
cases involving Proceed, Proceed Ventral Patch, Prolene Hernia System and related multi-layered mesh products, as well as a 
number of unfiled claims. All litigation activities in the two New Jersey MCLs are stayed pending effectuation of the proposed 
settlement. Future cases that are filed in the New Jersey MCLs will be subject to docket control orders requiring early expert 
reports and discovery requirements.

The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicon Physiomesh Flexible 
Composite Mesh, PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch, and PROLENE Polypropylene Hernia System products. 
Innovative Medicine 
RISPERDAL 
Claims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company arising out of the use of 
RISPERDAL, and related compounds, indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed episodes associated 
with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism. Lawsuits primarily have been filed in state courts in Pennsylvania, 
California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the United States and Canada. Product liability lawsuits 
continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated 
number of cases. The Company has successfully defended a number of these cases but there have been verdicts against the 
Company, including a verdict in October 2019 of $8.0 billion of punitive damages related to one plaintiff, which the trial judge 
reduced to $6.8 million in January 2020. In September 2021, the Company entered into a settlement in principle with the 
counsel representing plaintiffs in this matter and in substantially all of the outstanding cases in the United States. The costs 
associated with this and other settlements are reflected in the Company's accruals. 
ELMIRON 
Claims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company, arising out of the use of ELMIRON, a prescription medication indicated for the relief of 
bladder pain or discomfort associated with interstitial cystitis. These lawsuits, which allege that ELMIRON contributes to the 
development of permanent retinal injury and vision loss, have been filed in both state and federal courts across the United 
States. In December 2020, lawsuits filed in federal courts in the United States, including putative class action cases seeking 
medical monitoring, were organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of New 
Jersey. All cases in the multi-district litigation are in active discussions regarding resolution, and as a result, all activity is 
stayed. In addition, cases have been filed in various state courts of New Jersey, which have been coordinated in a multi-county 
litigation in Bergen County, as well as the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, which have been coordinated and granted 
mass tort designation. No activity has taken place in the New Jersey state court litigation; however, three bellwether trials 
have been set in Philadelphia for March, April and May 2024. In addition, three class action lawsuits have been filed in Canada. 
Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential 
costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has established accruals for defense and indemnity costs associated 
with ELMIRON related product liability litigation. 
Intellectual property 
Certain subsidiaries of the Company are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to patent, 
trademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters involve challenges 
to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products and allegations that certain of the Company's products 
infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses to these 
challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these 
matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in 
loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity, require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a 
non-cash impairment charge for any associated intangible asset. 
Innovative Medicine - litigation against filers of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) 
The Company's subsidiaries have brought lawsuits against generic companies that have filed ANDAs with the U.S. FDA (or 
similar lawsuits outside of the United States) seeking to market generic versions of products sold by various subsidiaries of the 
Company prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These lawsuits typically include allegations of 
non-infringement and/or invalidity of patents listed in FDA's publication "Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic 
Equivalence Evaluations" (commonly known as the Orange Book). In each of these lawsuits, the Company's subsidiaries are 
seeking an order enjoining the defendant from marketing a generic version of a product before the expiration of the relevant 
patents (Orange Book Listed Patents). In the event the Company's subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or any 
automatic statutory stay expires before the court rulings are obtained, the generic companies involved would have the ability, 
upon regulatory approval, to introduce generic versions of their products to the market, resulting in the potential for 
substantial market share and revenue losses for the applicable products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge 
in any associated intangible asset. In addition, from time to time, the Company's subsidiaries may settle these types of actions

Corrupt Practices Act from the United States Department of Justice and the United States Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
In July 2023, the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") issued Civil Investigative Demands to the Company, Johnson & Johnson 
Surgical Vision, Inc., and Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc. (collectively, "J&J Vision") in connection with a civil investigation 
under the False Claims Act relating to free or discounted intraocular lenses and equipment used in eye surgery, such as 
phacoemulsification and laser systems. J&J Vision has begun producing documents and information responsive to the Civil 
Investigative Demands. J&J Vision is in ongoing discussions with the DOJ regarding its inquiry. 
Innovative Medicine 
In July 2016, the Company and Janssen Products, LP were served with a qui tam complaint pursuant to the False Claims Act 
filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging the off-label promotion of two HIV products, 
PREZISTA and INTELENCE, and anti-kickback violations in connection with the promotion of these products. The complaint 
was filed under seal in December 2012. The federal and state governments have declined to intervene, and the lawsuit is being 
prosecuted by the relators. The Court denied summary judgment on all claims in December 2021. Daubert motions were 
granted in part and denied in part in January 2022, and the case is proceeding to trial. Trial is scheduled for May 2024. 
In March 2017, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (JBI) received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United States Department of Justice 
regarding a False Claims Act investigation concerning management and advisory services provided to rheumatology and 
gastroenterology practices that purchased REMICADE or SIMPONI ARIA. In August 2019, the United States Department of 
Justice notified JBI that it was closing the investigation. Subsequently, the United States District Court for the District of 
Massachusetts unsealed a qui tam False Claims Act complaint, which was served on the Company. The Department of Justice 
had declined to intervene in the qui tam lawsuit in August 2019. The Company filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted in 
part and denied in part. Discovery is underway. 
From time to time, the Company has received requests from a variety of United States Congressional Committees to produce 
information relevant to ongoing congressional inquiries. It is the policy of Johnson & Johnson to cooperate with these inquiries 
by producing the requested information. 
General litigation 
The Company or its subsidiaries are also parties to various proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental 
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and comparable state, local or foreign laws in 
which the primary relief sought is the Company's agreement to implement remediation activities at designated hazardous 
waste sites or to reimburse the government or third parties for the costs they have incurred in performing remediation as such 
sites. 
In October 2017, certain United States service members and their families brought a complaint against a number of 
pharmaceutical and medical devices companies, including Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries in United States 
District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that the defendants violated the United States Anti-Terrorism Act. The 
complaint alleges that the defendants provided funding for terrorist organizations through their sales practices pursuant to 
pharmaceutical and medical device contracts with the Iraqi Ministry of Health. In July 2020, the District Court dismissed the 
complaint. In January 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed the District 
Court's decision. In June 2023, defendants filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. 
In February 2024, a putative class action was filed against the Company, the Pension & Benefits Committee of Johnson & 
Johnson, and certain named officers and employees, in United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The 
complaint alleges that defendants breached fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) by 
allegedly mismanaging the Company's prescription -drug benefits program. The complaint seeks damages and other relief. 
MedTech 
In October 2020, Fortis Advisors LLC (Fortis), in its capacity as representative of the former stockholders of Auris Health Inc. 
(Auris), filed a complaint against the Company, Ethicon Inc., and certain named officers and employees (collectively, Ethicon) in 
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. The complaint alleges breach of contract, fraud, and other causes of action 
against Ethicon in connection with Ethicon's acquisition of Auris in 2019. The complaint seeks damages and other relief. In 
December 2021, the Court granted in part and denied in part defendants' motion to dismiss certain causes of action. All claims 
against the individual defendants were dismissed. The trial was held in January 2024 and the decision is pending.

In June 2019, the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a Civil Investigative Demand to the Company and 
Janssen Biotech, Inc. (collectively, Janssen) in connection with its investigation of whether Janssen's REMICADE contracting 
practices violate federal antitrust laws. The Company has produced documents and information responsive to the Civil 
Investigative Demand. Janssen is in ongoing discussions with the FTC staff regarding its inquiry. 
In February 2022, the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued Civil Investigative Demands to Johnson & 
Johnson and Janssen Biotech, Inc. (collectively, Janssen) in connection with its investigation of whether advertising practices 
for REMICADE violate federal law. Janssen has produced documents and information responsive to the Civil Investigative 
Demands. Janssen is in ongoing discussions with the FTC staff regarding the inquiry. 
In June 2022, Genmab A/S filed a Notice for Arbitration with International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution 
(CPR) against Janssen Biotech, Inc. seeking milestones and an extended royalty term for Darzalex FASPRO. In April 2023, the 
Arbitration Panel ruled in Janssen's favor and dismissed Genmab's claims. In January 2024, Genmab's appeal of this dismissal 
was denied. 
In October 2018, two separate putative class actions were filed against Actelion Pharmaceutical Ltd., Actelion 
Pharmaceuticals U.S., Inc., and Actelion Clinical Research, Inc. (collectively Actelion) in United States District Court for the 
District of Maryland and United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The complaints allege that Actelion violated 
state and federal antitrust and unfair competition laws by allegedly refusing to supply generic pharmaceutical manufacturers 
with samples of TRACLEER. TRACLEER is subject to a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy required by the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration, which imposes restrictions on distribution of the product. In January 2019, the plaintiffs dismissed the 
District of Columbia case and filed a consolidated complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. 
In December 2023, a putative class action lawsuit was filed against the Company and Janssen Biotech Inc. (collectively 
"Janssen") in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The complaint alleges that Janssen violated 
federal and state antitrust laws and other state laws by delaying biosimilar competition with STELARA through the Janssen's 
enforcement of patent rights covering STELARA. The complaint seeks damages and other relief. 
In June 2022, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. filed a Demand for Arbitration against Emergent Biosolutions Inc. et al. (EBSI) with 
the American Arbitration Association, alleging that EBSI breached the parties' Manufacturing Services Agreement for the 
Company's COVID-19 vaccine. In July 2022, Emergent filed its answering statement and counterclaims. The hearing is 
scheduled for July 2024.

20. Restructuring 
In fiscal 2023, the Company commenced restructuring actions within its Innovative Medicine and MedTech segments. The 
amounts and details of the current year programs are included below. 
In fiscal 2023, the Company completed a prioritization of its research and development (R&D) investment within its Innovative 
Medicine segment to focus on the most promising medicines with the greatest benefit to patients. This resulted in the exit of 
certain programs within certain therapeutic areas. The R&D program exits are primarily in infectious diseases and vaccines 
including the discontinuation of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) adult vaccine program, hepatitis and HIV development. 
Pre-tax Restructuring expenses of $479 million in the fiscal year 2023, included the termination of partnered and non-
partnered development program costs and asset impairments. The estimated costs of these total activities is between 
$500 million - $600 million and is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2024. 
In fiscal 2023, the Company initiated a restructuring program of its Orthopaedics franchise within the MedTech segment to 
streamline operations by exiting certain markets, product lines and distribution network arrangements. The pre-tax 
restructuring expense of $319 million in the fiscal year 2023 primarily included inventory and instrument charges related to 
market and product exits. The estimated costs of the total program are between $700 million - $800 million and is expected 
to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2025. 
The following table summarizes the restructuring expenses for the fiscal year 2023: 
(Pre-tax Dollars in Millions) 2023 
Innovative Medicine Segment(1) $479 
MedTech Segment(2) 319 
Total Programs $798 
Included $449 million in Restructuring and $30 million in Cost of products sold on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings 
Included $40 million in Restructuring and $279 million in Cost of products sold on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings 
Restructuring reserves as of December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023 were insignificant.

21. Kenvue separation and discontinued operations 
On May 8, 2023, Kenvue, completed an initial public offering (the IPO) resulting in the issuance of 198,734,444 shares of its 
common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Kenvue Common Stock"), at an initial public offering of $22.00 per share for 
net proceeds of $4.2 billion. The excess of the net proceeds from the IPO over the net book value of the Johnson & Johnson 
divested interest was $2.5 billion and was recorded to additional paid-in capital. As of the closing of the IPO, Johnson & 
Johnson owned approximately 89.6% of the total outstanding shares of Kenvue Common Stock and at July 2, 2023, the non-
controlling interest of $1.3 billion associated with Kenvue was reflected in equity attributable to non-controlling interests in the 
consolidated balance sheet in the fiscal second quarter of 2023. 
On August 23, 2023, Johnson & Johnson completed the disposition of an additional 80.1% ownership of Kenvue Common 
Stock through an exchange offer, which resulted in Johnson & Johnson acquiring 190,955,436 shares of the Company's 
common stock in exchange for 1,533,830,450 shares of Kenvue Common Stock. The $31.4 billion of Johnson & Johnson 
common stock received in the exchange offer is recorded in Treasury stock. Following the exchange offer, the Company owns 
9.5% of the total outstanding shares of Kenvue Common Stock that was recorded in other assets within continuing operations 
at the fair market value of $4.3 billion as of August 23, 2023. Subsequent changes are reflected in other income/expense and 
amounted to $0.4 billion expense through December 31, 2023. 
Johnson & Johnson divested net assets of $11.6 billion as of August 23, 2023, and the accumulated other comprehensive loss 
attributable to the Consumer Health business at that date was $4.3 billion. Additionally, at the date of the exchange offer, 
Johnson & Johnson decreased the non-controlling interest by $1.2 billion to record the deconsolidation of Kenvue. This 
resulted in a non-cash gain on the exchange offer of $21.0 billion that was recorded in Net earnings from discontinued 
operations, net of taxes in the consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal third quarter of 2023. This one-time gain 
includes a gain of $2.8 billion on the Kenvue Common Stock retained by Johnson & Johnson. The gain on the exchange offer 
qualifies as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
Also in connection with the separation, Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue entered into a separation agreement and also entered 
into various other agreements that provide for certain transactions to effect the transfer of the assets and liabilities of the 
Consumer Health business to Kenvue and to govern various interim and ongoing relationships between Kenvue and Johnson & 
Johnson following the completion of the Kenvue IPO, including transition services agreements (TSAs), transition manufacturing 
agreements (TMAs), trademark agreements, intellectual property agreements, an employee matters agreement, and a tax 
matters agreement. Under the TSAs, Johnson & Johnson will provide Kenvue various services and, similarly, Kenvue will provide 
Johnson & Johnson various services. The provision of services under the TSAs generally will terminate within 24 months 
following the Kenvue IPO. Additionally, Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue entered into TMAs pursuant to which Johnson & 
Johnson will manufacture and supply to Kenvue certain products and, similarly, Kenvue will manufacture and supply to Johnson 
& Johnson certain products. The terms of the TMAs range in initial duration from 3 months to 5 years. 
Amounts related to the TSAs and TMAs included in the consolidated statements of earnings were immaterial for the fiscal year 
2023. Additionally, the amounts due to and from Kenvue for the above agreements was not material as of December 31, 2023. 
The results of the Consumer Health business (previously reported as a separate business segment), as well as the associated 
gain, have been reflected as discontinued operations in the Company's consolidated statements of earnings as Net earnings 
from discontinued operations, net of taxes. Prior periods have been recast to reflect this presentation. As a result of the 
separation of Kenvue, Johnson & Johnson incurred separation costs of $986 million, $1,089 million and $67 million in the fiscal 
years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which are also included in Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes. 
These costs were primarily related to external advisory, legal, accounting, contractor and other incremental costs directly 
related to separation activities. In the fiscal 2022, as part of the planned separation of the Company's Consumer Health 
business, the Company recognized approximately $0.5 billion in net incremental tax costs. As of January 1, 2023, the assets 
and liabilities associated with the Consumer Health business were classified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations 
in the consolidated balance sheets.

Report of independent registered public accounting firm 
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Johnson & Johnson 
Opinions on the financial statements and internal control over financial reporting 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as 
of December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of comprehensive income, of 
equity and of cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes 
(collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over 
financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for 
each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective 
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated 
Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
Basis for opinions 
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal 
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, 
included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to 
express opinions on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial 
reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. 
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform 
the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material 
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in 
all material respects. 
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond 
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the 
consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates 
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of 
internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of 
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered 
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting 
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures 
that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to 
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the 
company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical audit matters 
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial 
statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or 
disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or 
complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate 
opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves — managed care, medicare and medicaid 
As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from product sales when 
obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Rebates and discounts provided to customers are 
accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability for such rebates and discounts is 
recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance sheet. A significant portion of the 
liability related to rebates is from the sale of pharmaceutical goods within the U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and 
Medicaid programs, which amounted to $11.5 billion as of December 31, 2023. For significant rebate programs, which include 
the U.S. Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid rebate programs, rebates and discounts estimated by management are based 
on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. 
pharmaceutical market. 
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves 
- Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management due to the 
significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing these reserves and the high degree of auditor judgment, 
subjectivity and audit effort in performing procedures and evaluating the assumptions related to contractual terms, historical 
experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market. 
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to 
U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid, including controls over the assumptions used to 
estimate these rebates. These procedures also included, among others, (i) developing an independent estimate of the rebates 
by utilizing third party information on price and market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market, the terms of the specific 
rebate programs, and the historical experience and trend analysis of actual rebate claims paid; (ii) testing rebate claims 
processed by the Company, including evaluating those claims for consistency with the contractual and mandated terms of the 
Company's rebate arrangements; and (iii) comparing the independent estimates to management's estimates. 
Litigation contingencies — talc 
As described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss contingencies 
associated with legal matters, including talc, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can 
be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse awards, judgments, or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, 
management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. For these 
matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued 
for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily 
on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be 
affected by various factors, including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or 
indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters 
present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and 
unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of 
related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. Management continues to believe that the 
Company has strong legal grounds to contest the talc verdicts it has appealed. Notwithstanding management's confidence in 
the safety of the Company's talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has settled cases. The Company has 
recognized a total provision of approximately $9 billion, of which approximately one-third is recorded as a current liability and 
which encompasses actual and contemplated settlements. The recorded amount remains the Company's best estimate of 
probable loss after the dismissal. The parties have not yet reached a full resolution of all talc matters and the Company is 
unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the remaining amount accrued. 
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the talc litigation is a critical audit 
matter are the significant judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being incurred, when determining 
whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss for the future and existing talc claims can be made, and when 
determining the timing of any settlement payments, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and 
effort in performing procedures and evaluating management's assessment of the loss contingencies associated with 
this litigation.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to 
management's evaluation of the talc litigation, including controls over determining whether a loss is probable and whether the 
amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement disclosures. These procedures also included, among 
others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company's process around the accounting and reporting for the talc litigation; (ii) 
obtaining and evaluating certain executed settlement agreements related to the talc litigation (iii) discussing the status of 
significant known actual and potential litigation and settlements activity with the Company's in-house legal counsel, as well as 
external counsel when deemed necessary; (iv) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external 
legal counsel for significant litigation; (v) evaluating the reasonableness of management's assessment regarding whether an 
unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable; and (vi) evaluating the sufficiency of the 
Company's litigation contingencies disclosures.

Management's report on internal control over financial reporting 
Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the Company's 
internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the 
Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective. 
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. 
The Company's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the 
Company's financial reporting and the preparation of external financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. 
Internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control 
over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement 
preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to 
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the 
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
The Company's management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in "Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)." These criteria are in 
the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. The 
Company's assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of its 
internal controls over financial reporting. 
Based on the Company's processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 
2023, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective. 
The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which 
appears herein.

Item 9. Changes in and disagreements with accountants on 
accounting and financial disclosure 
Not applicable. 
Item 9A. Controls and procedures 
Disclosure controls and procedures. At the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company evaluated the effectiveness 
of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company's disclosure controls and procedures are 
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the 
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. 
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information 
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and 
communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons 
performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Joaquin Duato, Chairman 
and Chief Executive Officer, and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated 
in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Duato and Wolk concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this 
Report, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
Reports on internal control over financial reporting. The information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference 
to Management's report on internal control over financial reporting, and the attestation regarding internal controls over 
financial reporting included in the report of independent registered public accounting firm included in Item 8 of this Report. 
Changes in internal control over financial reporting. During the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023, there were no changes 
in the Company's internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required under 
Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the 
Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Company continues to monitor and assess the effectiveness of the 
design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. 
The Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise -wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize processes and 
systems for the human resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance functions. These are 
enhancements to support the growth of the Company's financial shared service capabilities and standardize financial systems. 
This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the Company's internal control over financial 
reporting. In response to this initiative, the Company has and will continue to align and streamline the design and operation of 
its financial control environment. 
Item 9B. Other information 
Securities trading plans of Directors and Executive Officers. During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, none of our directors or 
officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) informed us of the adoption or termination of a "Rule 10b5-1 trading 
arrangement" or "non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement," each as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K. 
Item 9C. Disclosure regarding foreign jurisdictions that 
prevent inspections 
Not applicable.

CERTIFICATION OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER 
PURSUANT TO SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT 
I, Joaquin Duato, certify that: 
1. I have reviewed this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the "report") of 
Johnson & Johnson (the "Company"); 
2. Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a 
material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements 
were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
3. Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly 
present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of, and 
for, the periods presented in this report; 
4. The Company's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure 
controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial 
reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the Company and have: 
(a) Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures 
to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its 
consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in 
which this report is being prepared; 
(b) Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial 
reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles; 
(c) Evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in 
this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the 
period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
(d) Disclosed in this report any change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that 
occurred during the Company's most recent fiscal quarter (the Company's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an 
annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal 
control over financial reporting; and 
5. The Company's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal 
control over financial reporting, to the Company's auditors and the audit committee of the Company's board 
of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
(a) All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over 
financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, 
summarize and report financial information; and 
(b) Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a 
significant role in the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

1. I have reviewed this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the "report") of 
Johnson & Johnson (the "Company"); 
2. Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a 
material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements 
were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
3. Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly 
present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of, and 
for, the periods presented in this report; 
4. The Company's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure 
controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial 
reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the Company and have: 
(a) Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures 
to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its 
consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in 
which this report is being prepared; 
(b) Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial 
reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles;

(d) Disclosed in this report any change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that 
occurred during the Company's most recent fiscal quarter (the Company's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an 
annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal 
control over financial reporting; and 
5. The Company's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal 
control over financial reporting, to the Company's auditors and the audit committee of the Company's board of 
directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
(a) All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over 
financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, 
summarize and report financial information; and 
(b) Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a 
significant role in the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
